general population are idiots stypes dont waste time on them who was the greatest poet to ever live homer obviously there are other answers to that question but theyre wrong sublimely impersonal this is what poetry was before typemention like sappho invented lyric poetry the greatest poetry should at least be balanced somehow â the confessional style you see at slam poetry nights is never going to be seen as comparable to yeats or if it is i hope im dead by thenits more than thatthe abstract impersonal formulation gives meaning to the private personal experienceand also connects it to the experiences of others what else could nothing means anything without contextemotions are interesting to me in that they point to possibilities they point beyond themselves theres nothing interesting to me about someone simply declaring i feel like this as thought it were profound in the same way that the most interesting thing about language is its limits â what really interests people and what people would most like to talk about is that which cannot be said or so i think,38,86,10,3,69

behave more feminine before kicking in the badassery dress in softer colours to look more feminine and likeable always smile and ask people how they are doing how their trip to lake x was last week or if their kid finally recovered from his or her flu set the tone by being feminine and soft and only then be the strong woman who pushes the agenda while still smiling kindlythat also is something in general to keep in mind also for men you can be just as effective in reaching your goals and getting through to people without any aggression in your voice and body language being likeable kind and approachable is very important in getting people on your side you want people to be on your side because they want to be on your team and not because they are afraid of you,2,92,31,60,53

hades was never a tanksince were talking about nonconquest ill point out that his primary role in assault is healer if your teammates are smart enough to let you do it mine never areas for health vs prots it depends on where youre at in the spectrum say 1200 damage is coming in per second hunters aas whatever if they have 30 flat pen and you have just 30 prot youre taking 1200 dps if you have 50 prot after pen youre only taking 800 dps thats a difference of 400 health every second if you want enough protection to knock it down another 400 though youd have to get all the way up to 200 prot after pen so basically you want enough protections so that you have at least 50 after their pen then lots of health on top if that,25,71,49,17,45

you want to stay true to your inner self your feelings thats why it causes such thingsthis is a question is it better to be yourself as you are or some other artificial version of you yes maybe it would be more adaptable to the outer world and wouldnt hurt like that and cause all of these issues you mentioned but on the other hand it wont feel authentic and true and real youmaybe then you will think fuck this fake image of myself im trying to act as i just want to be myself as i really am and its more important to me than all the issues it may cause with itbut you know there are more colors than two black and white is not all there is you still can be typemention or how you are but change or at least tune some of these patterns you are typemention but you are yourself first of all every typemention is different everyone got a unique path stick to what feel right to your highest and deepest self not to your fears anxieties if someone doesnt deserve to be nice with dont be or at least dont be fully nice if you feel you are being used listen to yourself if doesnt really feels right and its your right to stop it its ok to not help such abusive ppl its better for them to deal with it themselfs you helping them by saying hey i dont really want to do it now sorry yes you dont want to dissapoint ppl cos it feels bad to do it but if at the same time you feel its actually better and truer to yourself and maybe for other persons development aswell it will overweight the dissapointing feeling in your feeling sphere and will allow you as typemention to act like that and stop being used all the time if it makes any sense for you its hard to explainbut i feel you its really hard to stick to yourself or rather your expectations of yourself and feelings you want to keep and the real world and things you have to deal with and balance it all together so youll be a functional human beingit even feels like a lifelong task for every typemention i think everyone thinks about such things and how to go around them and deal with themself what is the right way to think about all of this so you would find this balanced world view that would let your exist relatively peacefully with yourself and life so to think wider and deeper about yourself and all of this seem to be the way balancing cogfuncmention with cogfuncmention,40,98,1,1,83

i have always been a book lover i learned to walk in a library and i own about 1500 physical books but i recently bought a kindle i love the fact that its smaller than almost any individual physical book yet holds thousands of ebooks i love how its small size and reading light make it so easy to read in bed i also like the fact that most of what i want to read costs me less than half what a physical book would cost i wish i could afford to buy ecopies of all my physical booksbut i do love the look of a wall of books not keeping them free of mould and dust though physical books lend themselves better to browsing and discovery so are better for children and sometimes you want to have several books open at the same time but kindles dont support split screen and havent a big enough screen anyway,2,98,88,0,20

i personally think typemention people are more into doing than learning learning things out of books and lectures is tedious and boring after a short amount of timethat is what drove me away from medical in the first place aside from being a lazy a at school and not aiming for top grades in a levels sure it is interesting in essence but the way to get there is too boring imo,46,27,31,10,84

just because the comments section isnt a free for all debate doesnt mean the whole sub is garbage if you want memes and articles about how capitalism sucks its a decent sub people should think critically about the media they are consuming no matter where they find it i can see the value in spaces where you can just share links and discuss controversial topics without fending off attacks left and right nobody should rely on them as their sole source of news and political discussion but they are not inherently worthless i saw this there for instance i dont really read the comments on subs like that though,50,85,15,50,85
the other problem is that even when faced with more evidence they can be absolutely stubbornly unshakable i get the sense that before ive even gotten 15 of the way through sharing my thoughts on a complicated issue some of them have already passed judgment and are just waiting for their chance to tell me whats what i find it amusing because i choose to but only because i choose to,15,85,15,85,15
you seem like someone who approaches things very directly and rational and doesnt play passive aggressive games you already informed your so about your letteri would simply tell your so i have very good reason to believe you are cheating but if you say you are not i want to believe you because i love you and want to spend my life with you and if youre saying youre not cheating i need you to right here right now open up your phone email accounts bank and credit card statements facebook and other social media accounts so i can look through them you can stand next to me to watch me go through everything but for the sake of our relationship i need you to do this for memake a list of all accounts you want to have a look at beforehand also ask to go through his wallet so you can check for any credit cards you didnt know of and maybe youll find some cash receipts if he makes excuses you know hes a piece of shit because if hes clean after 5 years together surely he shouldnt have anything to hide you didnt already know if the roles were reversed and you were wrongly accused of cheating youd probably be willing to show everything to him no so if he doesnt want to yup hes cheatingdont tell him about the hotel etc with some luck youll find a cc statement for that hotel,46,27,31,10,84

i would say that consent is an ongoing process not just a one time thing fetuses use your fucking organs consent should be enthusiastic and continuousand anyway its disingenuous to pretend that the initial act of sex was performed to give permission for a fetus to take residence in the womans body it was usually about pleasure and the fetus was an unintended consequence the way youre framing is only demonizes women for having sex,50,85,15,50,85

your posts remind me of me when i was your age now about 10 years down the line i was around your age when i was also in full doubt about my own style and i was struggling at home emotionally around your age maybe a tad bit younger i went through an all out goth period because of itneedless to say i grew out of it but that time did teach me something very valuable going all out on the spectrum of what is socially acceptable and lets be honest on the teenage girl spectrum very little is socially acceptable put me in a category that was totally outside of any social convention it was hard and not everybody around me accepted me for it but in the end it thought me that i dont need acceptance or acknowledgement from anyone else but myself i went to the extreme side of expressing myself through appearance got burned and had to face social outcry because of it but in the end after the world around me got used to me being different i settled on a style that was me which is still for many outside of the traditional fashion norm lots of pretty vintage inspired silhouettes with a modern twist to take it to the 21st century but it made me happy now i find myself in a place where i can wear anything i want because i still am not worried at all about what others may think and despite being outside of the norm i get so many compliments on how i look because i am confident and secure in how i carry myselfif you dare i would totally recommend you doing you and wearing what you like hell take it 2 steps further and dare to wear stuff of which you know people will hate it and love yourself for it embrace being different embrace being your own individual self and keep repeating to yourself nobody needs to like you but you,46,27,31,10,84
not sure how term limits empower contributors since they would actually have to spend more money over the long term to find politicians that take sympathy to their cause since the politician that was previously sympathetic to their causeissue isnt able to hold that office anymore edit current system allows for contributors to get a huge return on their investment the longer the politician is in their pocket eliminating that makes them spend more resources,89,59,95,7,43

its a fair question yet something that i have difficulty with to explain i was raised outside of serbia and although my parents mother didnt explicitly raise me based on a strong serbian heritage it has been a constant factor throughout my life as i was raised with the serbian language i visited church often as a child many family members still live in the balkans who we visit often my grandparents own lands and houses passed down many generations etc my mother decided not to claim citizenship for me or for herself as when yugoslavia fell shed been living in our home country for a long time and also gained citizenship of this country and decided it wasnt worth it to her and felt rather strongly that i in that case also shouldnt get citizenship however i cant explain it but as i grew older i simultaneously got more connected to my serbian heritage and how it influenced my through out my childhood while also getting more disconnected to it as without my parentsmother i didnt have any tangible roots there it kept eating at me this feeling of uncertainty confusion and also a feeling a pride for my background i couldnt place i felt my mother by deciding i shouldnt get citizenship took something from me that actually did belong to me once i found out i could only claim citizenship through decent until my 23rd i believe i just decided i wanted to do this as in the end all i had to loose was some time and moneythat being said i travel a lot as well and i must admit having visa free access to countries like russia and china does have its benefits,93,30,40,12,67

well first of all cogfuncmention and cogfuncmention usually love each other so that is not a problematic difference typemention have tert cogfuncmention and were usually pretty fond of using it typemention really like this because it means we can follow them logically pretty well because we have the same thinking and feeling functions i think typemention can understand what we want better than they can with most typemention typemention and typemention are both kind of powered by strong principles which makes them pretty similar but not necessarily compatible,50,85,15,50,85

im mindblowingly awkward at receiving compliments the purely physical ones make me so uncomfortable i always either blurt out a completely unrelated statement said with way more assertiveness than i ever use normally or followup with some tangential information about whatever it is they complimented its such a fucking weird impulsebut i would say the problems i have with receiving compliments come down to 1 just not knowing how to person so the awkwardness of social interaction in general and 2 having the realization that other people notice you terrifying i dont really have the makes me think less of the person that complimented me part you mentionedthat being said holy shit yes to your last point but i dont know how to begin to respond without this turning into an even longer novelill just say grad school has been a real eyeopener in that department,83,87,9,24,61
any pics if you have good insertions and made gains relatively quickly as a natural then the skys the limit in bodybuilding itll be entirely down to you to be successful even if you dont make it into the ifbb all you have to do is look aesthetic on ig gain followers then push your own supplement and clothing products like joeyswoll etc sorry for a douchey example its a lot easier to be self made in the bodybuilding world as your success is pretty much 80 correlated to how hard you work and how motivated you are as you have control over your situationhowever you would have to be extremely determined something only 1 of the population has you might think youre that 1 but even top level bodybuilders with real deadlines sponsors and they depend on it for a living face mental and physical challenges by training taking in so much food and extreme use of supplementsi would honestly recommend that you continue your accounting degree so that you have a fallback option you just have to push through it you dont have to do amazing if its not your passion but at least pass with decent employable grades what are you going to do if you dont make it and youre stuck without a degree youre going to have to spend another 34 years studying again youre back to square one or risk worse such as being on welfare you still have 1 or 2 years right might aswell finish it anyways i think your issue comes from senioritis and exhaustion rather than a hate for accounting extremely few people are actually lucky enough to do what they love for a living but thats not to say you cant pursue bodybuilding as you can also easily juggle both study and bodybuilding whilst in college theres no reason they need to be mutually exclusive cody montgomery started in high school and won the teen juniors 3x whilst completing a college degree,45,92,54,62,9
ive used a lot of different drugstore foundations and i can say that ive been using primarily revlon colorstay foundation since i first tried it i spend excessive amounts of money on makeup but honestly this 10 dollar foundation is pale enough for me has decent coverage doesnt look cakey and is nice to my skin 110 is the palest shade they have i believe but its the best inexpensive foundation option for pale skin most inexpensive light shade foundation either still isnt light enough or it oxidizes revlon doesnt oxidize and 110 is a very ivory shadeanyways since it is still lower end foundation id suggest pairing it with a decent primer and setting spray especially if you want long lasting coverageare going to be out in the heat,61,73,54,17,20

thats nice to hear that our exchanges of music werent a total waste and everyone got something from it if you liked some omnia you should consider listening to some faun aswell at some point it the same concept of using older instruments forgoten ethnic lyrics in different languages and ancient motives well at least their older stuff newer it is poppier music become probably my favorite songs ever is from faun aswell lyrics have a big part in it though and its german so you prolly wont value it but you could prolly appreciate some of their instrumental or atmospheric songs cheers,40,98,1,1,83

no because a person is different in every situation you will never really know what anyone is like when youre not around even if you were to surround them with invisible drones for a full 360 surround you are still tied to your own perceptions and interpretations a person can only be described holistically in comparison to others and only in specific situations as a baseball player compared to other baseball players as evidenced by xyz bob is fast if a person places their locus of self in their external actions and what you perhaps consider superficial then who is to say which one of you understands himher better you may create or map a system of abstraction onto a person by which you can somewhat possibly understand them better though this will be subject to your own cognitive biases etc consider the massive discrepancy in certainty between describing a persons character and describing our own we wouldnt devote nearly so much time to introspection if after some decades we had finally figured ourselves out i think that people including ourselves are largely unknowable along the timeframesscales we tend to attempt to characterize them connections and understanding happen in moments not lifetimes with some few its possible to continually string those moments together perhaps perpetually but no two moments or two people are ever quite the same twice life would be so boring if more emotionally comfortable if it werent so,15,85,15,85,15

do you think your current house is a future proof long term residencei would say that the most important aspect of fire is having a paid off house that way you wont need to have such a large investment portfolio in order to fund housing costs which is by far the biggest component of living expenses the only way to eliminate housing costs is to own your own home and then you need the money for general living costs and disposable income thus given your goals of fire at 31 and the redhot market id advise against selling i would rent it out instead,45,92,54,62,9

simple it has phenomenal experiences because it has representations of its external and internal world those representations are patterns of self and world the patterns themselves exist in a highly dimensional space like for example word embeddings in nlp the space of representations is the space of qualia representations feel like anything because they are causal in determining our future actions and self image the qualiaperception is just the first stage in reinforcement learning it feeds into the value function for selecting the next action the value function is emotion thats why it feels like something because it has causal effects to feel thatqualia is just kicking out the soulspirit out through the front door but bring it back through the back door its the idea that some things transcend mere mechanics instead theyd better wonder at the mysteries of mere mechanics its no stinking reductionism its full of depth and subtlety,57,90,21,15,43

typemention are often scary to talk to both my so and best friend understand how to communicate with me though bottom line is thisat any point in life work project whatever i know exactly where im going and how ill get there this does not mean this route is set in stone but it does mean this is the best path i could come up with having considered everything so both my so and friend often tell other people who are a bit intimidated by me when you discuss things with avacyn it feels like kicking a dead horse and she simply doesnt want to listen because she thinks she knows best but in reality she is actually listening very closely and is simply challenging you on your own opinion in any way she can come up with give it a week or two and if your argument was strong enough shell get back to you with new updated plans based on your inputthis was a huge eye opener for many people in my social circle but also for myself as i honestly did not know how my behaviour came across to other people who arent used to thing style of discussing things,2,92,31,60,53
i am typemention and i can relate to this generally often instead of using my eyes i overlay an image over the top of reality i take in how it feels it is a subjective impression it might be a map that represents the area generally cogfuncmention types are the ones that are very visually acutecogfuncmention is like focusing on what all of the signs are pointing to its like when you start to notice that everyone you have talked to today was sad and you ask what does that really meanthis is a form of introversion but it is not jungian introversion more related to the typical usage of the word eg not big on parties prefers to read a book it is known as highsensitivity can you give an example of this,34,21,82,74,20

in contrast to many others here apparently i dont believe true self confidence comes from building muscle or some other kind of great body thats just a very fragile and possibly narcissistic self confidence often fueled by self hatred self confidence is purely mental psychological its about working through your issues and discovering who you are and what your role or place in life is once you find that both your place and who you are you dont need external confirmation not even from a mirror its all beliefs the less the opinion of other people matters to you the less relevant something like your body becomes and the easier it is to live from a sense of freedom and ease,0,92,52,1,79
season 4 is either my favorite or tied for my favorite season its the perfect blend of everything i love about buffy we get a couple angel episodes we get spike back we get both oz and tara we get the only faith episodes i truly enjoy vamp harmony is hilarious buffy out of her element in college is hilarious etc and i actually like riley in season 4my main issue with the season is deus ex machina as badass as the ending was it came out of left field and why did they never try it again super buffy would be unstoppable she was unbelievably powerful and it killed my suspension of disbeliefalso i hated restless upon first viewing the second time was much better since i knew what to expect but i feel like it wouldve been a better season start than finisha couple episodes were dumb but even on my rewatch i still enjoyed the super campy stupid episodes more than some more boring episodes with less stupid plotsveruca came out of nowhere and was an obvious plot device to write oz out of the show if she had been better developed maybe i couldve dealt with that plotline but as it was it was hard to be sympathetici agree with another poster who said they killed walsh too soon i think she wouldve made a stronger villain than adam i wouldve liked to see the dynamic in class after she tried to have buffy killed i wouldve liked to see the power she had over adam and their dynamicoverall i think the pros waaaaaay outweigh the cons it has the perfect dynamic it was funny it was serious it had in my opinion the least amount of slow episodes that i dont care to rewatch its the perfect blend of what i like about the early seasons and what i like about the later seasons its the season in my opinion with the least to dislike theres a lot of camp but its funcamp not cringy camp,70,45,20,24,40

theres a saying that goes something like doms want to feel needed and subs need to feel wantedi think that the key term there is actually the word feel as in each typically wants the sense of it without necessarily the reality of itpersonally i dont fully subscribe to the thought it seems to be presenting but i do understand it in my experience and opinion a relationship any relationship works best if both people are able to function independently but when they work together both of them benefit even more the whole being greater than the sum of its parts as they saywhen someone truly needs another person to survive or function or just to feel happy then thats codependence thats unhealthy as it can create debilitating attachment issues and lead to all sorts of messy thingsive had subs before who werent submitting so much because they chose to but because they felt they had to they had the idea that they couldnt run their own lives whether individually true or not and so had to hitch their wagon to someone capable of handling it for themthats not submission thats outright immature lazinessnow obviously not all subs are like that there are some amazing ones out there who have executivelevel careers andor are athletically impressive andor possess all sorts of significantly badass merits sometimes these people choose to submit because they want a release from all of the pressures of their highpowered lives theyre so busy taking care of business during the day that all they want to do is come home and be contentedly taken care of themselves focusing on pleasing just one person instead of the whole damn worldand some subs embrace their passive personalities wanting a dom to orchestrate things not out of necessity but out of comfort one of the core traits of a sub is that heshe tends to be a peoplepleaser and as a dom its a wonderful feeling when someone who is so capable chooses to spend their efforts making you happyhonestly ive seen enough dysfunctional doms and subs to say fairly confidently that if someone cant handle their own lives much less handle a vanilla relationship then theyre going to be terrible at ds,15,95,85,15,5

it was alright there were parts i could relate to and parts i couldnt i prefer reading descriptions that talk more about a types flaws or insecurities because i feel it can be easier to distinguish type that waystill unsure on cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention vs cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention someone who watched my other video gave an interesting argument on why i might be cogfuncmention here,12,50,45,10,81
secondary ns are just noticeably less theoretical typemention arent more theoretical than typemention either but cogfuncmention loves to put ideas together out loud so it seems like theyre theorizing if you really listen they tend to state a string of facts and state a relationship between those facts its much more concrete to say x y z than to say given that x y z perhaps a b c if you spend some time in their sub youll notice a markedly less theoretical discussion than in the n dom subs rtypemention is a little different because cogfuncmention wants to pick everything apart down to counting the threads on the screws and their n is extraverted so they explore abstractions aloud when you present a theory to an typemention they will process it and present evidence as to why it is correct or incorrect they will compare it against their reality and often argue with you if they feel it is necessary when you present an apple to an typemention they will say yes its an apple when you present an apple to an n dom they might say you know ive often wondered what the world might be like without fruit would mammals have evolved without nuts and seeds blah blah fucking blah oh are you still here,15,85,15,85,15

i was always conflicted about the validity of subtypes when it was the simpler version of preferring your dominant or auxiliary or other such similar systems gulenko describes his dcnh system more as ones energy type to correspond with ones information type particularly when participating in groups this explanation i think is much more elegant and consistent with theory than being either a pedantic or goofy typemention from another article i think explains this welli was expecting to come up with any subtype other than the one i decided upon i ultimately decided that dominant makes the most sense with normalizing as a second choice i really thought it would be one of the perceiving based subtypes but no i think that an typemention with a cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention subtype is odd and that the dominant aspect would have to be much more muted than say a dominant extroverted type im curious what others have typed themselves as for their subtype,70,92,81,7,5

tough question depend on your definition of eq reallyi for example am really good at reading people i notice small changes in body language and speech immediately and instinctively know whether thats why someone is sad or is trying to deceive me for example i also very very quickly get a feeling for someones character when i meet new people in this sense i have very high eqbut this is the thing i adjust my own way of speaking pose and tone of voice to match whatever i want from that person based on what i read of them but doing so is honestly a very rational decision to be honest i really lack empathy i only experience real empathy with my dearest friends close family and my so so from this perspective my eq is shitefor example if my employee would come to me with a crisis situation a dying mother for example i would be super concerned in tone of voice and body language i would do anything to accommodate them to arrange things but this is because i want my employee and team to function best which is when they feel safe with me as their employer and safe in their job environment a stressed out employee is useless and will take the whole team down better to give them some time off to get their life back in order ill find a way to manage until then thats my job anyway but honestly i couldnt care less about the dying family member per se i simply feel nothing no sadness or any other empathic feelings,46,27,31,10,84

i have a very close typemention friend cogfuncmention is pretty high up their stack in many ways we relate our cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention and use it to connect cogfuncmention much like cogfuncmention is concerned with results its all about how do things connect to the real world what are the results of a thing a thing is defined by its results i get that i dig it i have to remind myself of it though my first instinct is what is the essence of the thing is it a similar essence to this other thing or this perhaps if so is there a unifying abstraction which relates the two if so is there another unifying abstraction i can relate besides its different typemention are a lot like typemention cogfuncmention is very similar to cogfuncmention its hard to separate them i think its mostly about that desire to completely divorce oneself from reality and dive into multiple dimensions of imagined correlations that sort of thing is more exciting than anything else to me that is cogfuncmention imo,15,85,15,85,15

i agree that kyle make a reasonable analysis and some good points harris is indeed very focussed on the ideological aspect of jihadism he see it as a great danger for the entire world the main issue i got with chomsky is that his views are terribly cynical toward the us chomsky has an encyclopedic knowledge of geopolitic but he cant shake away his anarcho syndicalism that is he believe their should be such a thing as a state its an even more utopian version of marxism therefore chomsky is always relucant in seeing anything right done by the us its damn if you do damn if you dont his objective is to shame the state at every opportunity in my view chomsky understanding of geopolitic isnt the problem i know thats the words harris used he understand geopolitic very well its his ideoligical views which are problematic he has tainted a two generations of liberals with his cynical view of us politic he is among the reason liberals are so incapable of forming a coherent foreign policy or reasoning about global politics with nuances chomskys fan absorbed 1 of his understanding of geopolitic but 100 of his cynicism and antistate message those liberals are blind to the danger of jihadism because of that as they are nothing more than revolutionaries fighting imperialism in their mind,39,89,1,22,61

good advice man you can use a similar method with figuring out the combinations to a lock if someone doesnt set their numbers to 0 they will usually set the numbers to things other than whatever their numbers actually are so you just have to track what numbers are being avoided and youll more than likely obtain the correct numbers to their combination,45,69,26,0,28

i think it motivates the ps too i was supporting and expanding on the idea not mine that all humans struggle with this in some way for at least some time that it is intrinsic to the human condition interesting what you say about individuality hmm you do have a concept of self right at least a list of traits which describe who you are what youre into what you want what you likedislike etc asserting that you struggle with experiencing is a statement of individuality people depersonalize when they speak of the human condition and personalize when they assert information about themselves which is purported to be unusual such as you just did this is my journey is another way to read of your struggle,15,85,15,85,15

i really like your analysis of cogfuncmention and its abstract conception of money professionally i have been a working class fly on the walls of the most successful and wealthy people of the world ive been able to overhear private conversations of ceos and people involved in all forms of big business the big take away that i learned about rich people is that money is an abstract concept for them an investor that is millions of dollars in debt is still richer than the man that has twenty bucks in his pocket these are examples of speculation the rich man is speculating that he can turn around his temporary financial troubles with his next business venture the poor man is speculating if he can pay his bills and afford certain luxuries like food i think this is a good example of cogfuncmention over cogfuncmention vs cogfuncmention over cogfuncmention either the rich man or the poor man if they are heavier cogfuncmention users and can integrate their cogfuncmention will see their current financial situation as fleeting but through cogfuncmention maybe know from experience that they will be just fine and be able to solve the problem the corollary to this is the miser either rich or poor that leads with higher cogfuncmention they hold on to their money and thus keep it just in case or like you said clip coupons these are the value of a dollar people rather than the money is a concept people the former are cogfuncmention heavy maybe born into their financial situation good or bad and the idea is to conserve and mitigate risks rather than the you gotta spend money to make money types one is expansive the other is conservative,70,92,81,7,5

although yes good programmes are selective the selection process is by far less intimidating compared to the us in europe doing a masters degree after a bachelor is more or less the minimum expectation of many employers instead of a thought through career choice as it usually is in the us because of this almost everyone who has done a bachelors degree reasonably well will find themselves a spot in a masters programme the selection they usually put in place is only to cut of the bottom percentages but not to select only the top percentages of course not including oxbridge etcwhat would be the average gpa of your fellow students is your university somewhere top 150 or even top 100 in the world ranking in my experience in the case of us universities the quality of the university determines a lot of your chances as there simply is a far broader range of quality and depth to them in europe most governments govern education quality extremely strict so any university in a specific country will not differ much in quality from the other ive had family members for example go to us colleges and return home only to find out their diplomas couldnt be converted to university level dutch diplomas but only applied science diplomas this is because according to the government the education quality of those specific uniscolleges did not line up with the quality the government expects from our unis,2,92,31,60,53
i think different types are interested in mbti for different reasons types with strong cogfuncmention might be interested in how its such a logical way to classify people and it has internal consistency people with cogfuncmention might enjoy how it does a good job describing cognition and behavior choices as a unified system and lets us understand people as a whole and look at them through different perspectives etc maybe cogfuncmention types use it for selfdiscovery and why they are uniquely themselves i mean different types value different things and have different motivations when it comes to selfunderstanding or knowing others this system just happens to be vague enough to be universally applied and generally understood but precise in other ways which make it reliable its like a swiss army knife where we each can use it different waysits a knife for some and a screw driver for others,83,80,46,37,14

if you are sexually active i suggest you and your partner use the internet to better educate yourselves for example there can be sperm cells released preejaculation sperm can live in the uterus for 57 days and women can still get their period or have spotting when they are pregnant women ovulate for a couple days so there is a window of time when she can become pregnant not worth the risk if you truly want to be childfree imo all good reasons to wear a condom on top of using birth control which is not 100 effective,57,80,86,79,55

could you use a mail forwarding service like forward2me i was in the uk id definitley help you out by posting it via royalmail which would cost less than 5 as i know what a pain it is to ship anything decent into australiaif you dont have any uk relatives then forward2me is your best option given that its a cap its a very small and light object with minimal packaging so it shouldnt be too expensive about 20 maximum from experience forwarding is great for designer clothes or small knick knacks but prohibitively expensive for larger items such as shoes or furniture,45,92,54,62,9

i would personally vouch for textbooks but as utimeandtype said if you have trouble being selfmotivated classes would be a better fitmost useful depends on what you want to do the most commonly used languages in the workforce are java and c they are mostly for big projects if you want to do web development php has 80 of the market python is becoming more popular alternative and you would likely need to learn javascript and html mysql jquery and other such things for back and frontend web developmenti study at home i set timers and do 3 chunks of 4 hour work sessions every day i no longer have a life d though much of that time is devoted to calculus i find working at libraries or we kind of suffocating like i cant just leave all of my stuff alone because it could get stolen which means if i want to go for a run or anything i need to carry everything which is just annoying plus you cant have music playing openlyim not aiming to build apps im mainly using code to do science mathematics and electronics but i did learn some gui development along the way in python it took roughly 50 hours to get some of the basics of the language down and then 20 hours to get familiar with all of the standard widgets by then i could do simple animations make calculators with buttons and charts window popups and all that kind of stuff but it would take longer to get good with it i would think you would want to learn phone app development if youre looking for a job in that kind of thing i think apple writes in swift and their own kind of c but youd want to look that stuff up,34,21,82,74,20

oh okay now its really easyi would create a user defined data type struct when compared to other languages that stores your data by way of individual skus each data struct would represent an individual sku and within that it stores an integer for the quantity sold in a particular country code this allows you to breakdown all sku sale quantities and price quantities if you wished to extend this in a human readable format once youve got your data type created we can move onto our arrays private type skuinformation id as string stores the sku itself for comparisons countrycodename1 as integer stores the quantity of the sku sold in that country code countrycodename2 as integer countrycodename3 as integer end typethis would be easiest with a multidimensional array from here you would copy your entire spreadsheets data into memory this allows for easy data manipulation after all the data is copied initially it does feel slow as it takes time to load everything but this means you can do fancier things later if you so wished it would be prudent to include a progress bar for this process if you will not be the only one using thisstuff useful for correctly sizing your arrays before you create them public function getlastrow as long getlastrow activesheetusedrangerowscount end functiononce you have your data stored in an array you can then declare your data struct array for each unique sku you have once this is created you are now set to begin adding up all of your sku data you will have to uniquely identify each sku so you can size your sku data struct array properly i recommend another smaller array that you can use to store sku names in to crossreference for unique skus and use the size of that to size your sku data structin this scenario it is possible to be able to loop through your entire multidimensional array just once to get everything added up so in this scenario i would have a main loop that looks up an sku finds it in the sku struct array and then selects a case statement of which country code it is from after that you can then add the quantity sold to your sku structs quantity for that country codeonce weve looped through the entire array and have everything totaled up the problem now falls onto displaying your data but we can get to that once the code for everything has been createdill be around for any questions all day d,45,69,26,0,28

well wwi lasted 4 years and had a death toll of 17 million taiping was 2030 million over 15 years so thats 425 million per year in wwi compared with 133 to 2 million per year for taipingwwii is the modern example for heavy death tolls at around 80 million an insane amount of death in a relatively short time period,2,85,2,86,30

im an engineer myself so i need a lot of math and it was a requirement for entry into my degree programme my uni did a large scale analysis of which factors can be a predictor of academic success the biggest surprise was that how well a student does in high school maths is a very strong predictor for how well the student will do at university this held true across all disciplines even stuff like art history degrees so we wondered why would this be to me its clear maths learns you determination and learning how to critically think reflect and analyse stuff on a highly abstract level all of these are qualities you need for not only stem degrees but also arts degrees which require to you to think creatively but still require a very analytical approach of that creative process to truly understand it so no you might not need maths when you want to make films but you will need the skills learning maths teaches you to become truly good at what you do,50,85,15,50,30

a whole brain zenlike pattern their zen state works best when focusing on a single question without distractioncogfuncmention seems to be related to flow also known as the zone the outside staring off into space on the inside inception now before you bother telling me its impossiblecogfuncmention is analog and nonlinear and cogfuncmentiondoms are the most visuospatial of all the typeshalfremembered data points are interpolated and interconnected into an overall pattern visualized as an interactive multidimensional model based on which certain insights seem entirely obviousintroduce the subject ask one question and wait for the answer we may need a few seconds to process but the answer comes fully formed though not always easy to describe in words then as an cogfuncmentionuser build on and speculate about the answer with your crazy ideas also dont expect us to remember every word a thousand years went by in our heads between the question and the answer so were bound to forget a few details,12,84,7,53,54

this is brilliant just so you know this isnt purely altruisticfrance especially and india both have huge energy companies and a large market share in many countries solar energy is a big threat especially towards nuclear and coal power in that respective orderwhat they are doing is snapping up all the land viable for solar energy then they invest in the energy market using their unmatched access to capital and huge economies of scale which pushes out domestic competitors harming their own economy this has the twofold effect of gaining market share and increased power over their politicians since these frenchindian companies control their energy market this offsets the decline in investment in nuclearcoal gives them new revenue streams more market share a bigger consumer base and ensures its long term survival and its politically convenient too more indirect control over these governments for future profit wouldnt be surprised if the frenchindian government recommended it and are financially backing this and they get to look like they care about the environment too good pr that can never hurt,45,92,54,62,9

so i have top comment on the thread you are referring toits not about marriage per se like you i dont think marriage is that important although i personally would like to get married if my partner was anti marriage id be fine with that too the whole point of my comment in that thread however is about knowing there is no long term outlook if you know your relationship will end badly in x years because you have some big disagreements which well end in drama and heartbreak why prolong the inevitable especially because the longer you wait the uglier the break up will beto answer your second question yes i am in a relationship with someone i intend to marry 4 years and counting if i didnt see myself with my so long term to me there wouldnt be a point to staying together with himalso i personally have no desire to date casually i dont feel any desire to sleep with guys i dont feel romantically attracted to and besides i am confident enough in myself my life is existing enough that i dont feel some weird fear of being alone or feeling worthless if im not in a relationship,50,85,50,85,50

an explanation why the fps should have to do simething with the tickrateget right viewed the data how many people have decent computers and said valve went on to say that 128 tick wouldnt be feasablehowever what most people miss is that valve never said it was due to fps and they also get the internet speeds and locations of the peoplei want to know why people are saying that it is all due to fps what are the problems with 128 tick for computers with lower fps or are you just saying that because get right said it somewhere and you actually have no clue why it is as you sayif that us the case i cant understand why people who say it is not due to fps and know what they are talking about get downvoted by people who have no clue about it otherwise you might link me the dev post where they explixitly say it us due to fps,46,27,31,10,84

i know its hard to be objective when youre the one going through such strong emotions and are frustrated hurt and just want to fix the problem even though youve come to us for advice i think youve answered your own question read your posts out loud to yourself and really listen to what youre saying read it as if you were listening to a stranger describe what theyre going through would you want that person to stay in this relationship would you describe whats going on as healthy not to bring it back to an typemention cogfuncmention thing but sometimes we need to externalize our feelings to really understand whats going on imagine what were seeing as we read thisa person who has clearly and repeatedly stated their needs to someone they care about and instead feels rejected patronized and is starting to bottle up their own feelings after theyve said being open and honest is what they strive for there might be an urge to stay and try to fix it but read what youve saidout loud do you think this is worth fixing should anyone have to work this hard to be accepted and understood by the person they lovetell him clearly that youve stated your case and dont see an improvement tell him you feel he isnt taking your concerns or feelings seriously and that you no longer feel comfortable being yourself around him unless you see change youre going to leave thats all there is to it good luck lt3,83,80,46,37,14

the us has a far bigger problem that maternity and paternity leave the problem is leave and vacation in general every time this topic comes up anywhere it quickly derails into feelings of jealously why should someone get extra leave just for popping out a child why cant i get leave for caring for my sick mother it is honestly ridiculous that the us does not have any statutory leave this has nothing to do with egalitarianism and everything to do with simply social minimum welfare one can expect from a developed country thats the true issue that being said i found the article to be rather weak the points stated have nothing to do with how hard paternity leave is frankly the points he made are simply called parenting and youll be doing it for another 20 years just like humankind has been doing for many many millions of years already in todays world having children is a lifestyle choice not a necessity yes parenting is hard thats a given and was to be expected no need for the martyrdom,93,30,40,12,67

i used a physical analogue but i dont think this is how i experience cogfuncmention to my thinking it more constructs hypotheses if youre dealing with a physical topic of interest like the molecular models in the example then im actively building hypothetical structures which could fit but the analogy is true for completing any pattern if its not a concrete pattern im looking for i dont usually visualize the objects im building but its an actively engaged intentional process for the most part if a b c then xyz we are talking now in another thread about how going with your gut is kind of a foreign cogfuncmention sort of concept my brain does shit out answers and make intuitive leaps but for the most part its asynch processing with cross linked promises and im watching it happen as it happens if that makes sense when my subconscious says the answer is blah blah if i dont know exactly how blah blah works and how it fits into the broader context i dont trust blah blah you can observe people doing it here as they write well start with an intuitive hunch like the op of this thread then build the rest around it as we go if you replace the word seen with considered then i agree what is the process for determining whether or not its useful i have noticed that the cogfuncmention users ive known seem to have a hard time explaining why something should work unless they have past precedent to go on without that its usually dogged insistence that it will work,15,85,15,85,15

perhaps consider that we were bred to develop crushes and behave irrationally for long enough that we breed its evolutionarily beneficial to have partners with multiple people even if this is detrimental to the individuals involved no matter what is going on in the rest of your brain your lizard brain is following a program to encourage you to minimize the possible impact of mating with someone who might have recessive traits which would render your offspring less evolutionarily fit if you breed with more than one person you have much better odds that your genes will survive when under the sway of this chemical cocktail you are extremely likely to ignore the faults of who your lizard wants you to bone and to overestimate their positive attributes you are also likely to downplayignore the likelypossible downsides of pursuing said strumpet what you the human dont know for certain is whether or not the relationship with this person will be good you dont know that after the hormones wear off you will still want to spend time with each other etc i would counsel you to consider whether or not there are things you arent currently getting in your current relationship which can either be worked on arent that big of a deal or which truly might constitute deal breakers were you even restless before your lizard brain took a shine to this guy,15,85,15,85,15

this is actually a really interesting point i frequent rchildfree and one of the main annoyances of the people of there is how they loose their friends when the friends become parents mostly because when people become parents the number one topic to talk about is children which childfree people are usually not really interested in thing is nothing really stops you from seeing your friends once you have children or more specifically if your friends had children how would that fact suddenly change why you will or wont be lonely i mean once you have children the reasons or the ability of your friends to visit you will not change child or not your friend needs to get in a car and make time to meet you,50,85,15,50,30

honestly i liked chris evansi never really understood why people didnt like him i thought he was a pretty decent presenter on top gear and i think most people unfairly pitted themselves against evans just because they love to hate him and they were comparing him against clarkson which was silly since evans would never be like clarkson no 2 people are alike i knew that the show would organically settle and find its own voice post hammond clarkson and may but i guess if firing evans stops viewers complaining and saves the show from a decline in popularity then i suppose its for the best,45,92,54,62,9

so which is worse ethically to farm animials in good conditions and kill them quickly or hunt wild foxes stressful final hours with a painful deathi think youre conflating the issue of poor treatment of some farmed animals to the overall idea of farming them of course there are still issues with how farm animals are raised fed milked transported and killed which is why people need to make decisions about how ethical what they buy is but its totally possible for farmed animals to live less stressed better fed and less sick than wild counterparts not to mention how screwed domesticated animals are if they are ever released to the wild,85,95,15,50,15

you live somewhere that its really really warm and dont really deal with cold often do youcause thats not quite how frostbite works also cold and snow dont necessarily go well together here when its 2 to 6ish degrees c thats perfect lotta snow temp but when it gets to 25c it might try to snow but itll be so fine as to not be of much consequenceeither though mix in high winds and its a blizzardanyway impossible to tell how cold it is there but youre barely going to feel the cold much just going for a piss unless theres like a 30degc or more windchill and probably wouldnt even be close to at risk for frostbite,9,61,13,4,72

my casual friends know me as a serene stable guy who can occasionally show some surprising amount of assertiveness and passion my closer friends and some of my exgirlfriends of course know me as a domlemme tell you each time i have the big reveal conversation it goes one of two wayseither its i knew it that makes so much sense and theres a lot of excited questions from them or its holy shit i had no idea um im uncomfortable nowas you can imagine the two responses are largely based upon the other persons misunderstanding of what bdsm is and more importantly what it is to me if their exposure and education on the matter consists of hollywood references then theyre going to assume this means im some sort of sex fiend who enjoys victimizing helpless women if theyve actually been curious and even looked into it themselves then suddenly im a potential gateway to a whole new world now i dont know your dad udaughterofdurin and i imagine hes not a dwarven king as advertised but im guessing he was raised in a very tame and static world hes got to be late in life and so he feels like hes got the world figured out pretty good he loves his daughter so anything that looks like a threat to her is going to be dealt with harshly when that threat appears to be her very sexuality then hes going to freak out even moreit looks like its been a few days since your text slipup so im guessing youve already tried at least one unfortunately difficult conversation with him about it depending upon how that went my advice may not be applicable but here goes anyway remember that he loves you and wants the best for you he thinks you might be deluded so hes not going to trust anything you say to defend yourself right off the bat youre going to have to rebuild his trust somehow before he even starts listening to you his mind is probably cooking up all sorts of reinterpretations of your past relationships did you do this stuff with that guy what about this one did they hurt you did they force you into it are you on drugs et cetera the only thing you can do to combat that paranoia is calmly show him how youve got your life together and are being a stable responsible adult show him that you arent out of control and that youre okay dont try to convince him that bdsm is okay hes going to have to figure that out for himself his shock has to wear off and he needs to feel like hes got a handle on his world again before he can even begin to entertain the idea that his little girl is alright can you try for some girltalk with your mother if shes more openminded about it if she trusts you then youll need her as an ally against your fathers avalanche of worry are there any siblings you can bring in as well youre doing nothing wrong yes the text misfire was a mistake but as long as you have confidence that you are being safe sane and consensual then you are living your life as you should much like a startled parent who just accidentally heard their child is gay this is just a transition phase when the truth first comes out its hard it means some things will never be the same again but its progress because its a more honest life now still all that said your sexuality is still none of your dads business he doesnt need to know how you like things done to you and he probably doesnt want to know all he cares about is that youre okayso just show him that youre okay show him that youre still going to school like you mean it show him that you love him and you appreciate how much he has given you to make you a better woman show him the strength that he worries you dont havegive him time to rebuild his faith in you itll be rough but itll eventually get better he still loves you,15,95,85,15,5

from your post so obviously some of these are more of an issue than others but every single one of these little nuggets from your post is a reason that calls for some critical introspection and self evaluation you need to be in a good place with yourself before you can actually be a good place for somebody else especially your references to suicide in combination with your self proclaimed emotional instability are reasons you need to seek therapy this is not something to be ashamed about or whatever its something you do to make yourself a better person if anything you can go into competition with yourself to be the best possible you how can you expect you can truly and fully love someone if you clearly cant even bring up enough love to love yourself enough to take proper care of yourself,93,30,40,12,67

i love louie it is one of the most honest comedies ive seen i identify with his awkwardness and ability to struggle through all the bullshit that life deals you all the while dusting yourself off and going through the same absurd bullshit over and over again hoping for a better result he depicts the modern human condition pretty well for people like us he is well liked well intentioned has some success pursuing his calling but everything just ends up wrong in a very relatable way he just seems lost when trying to deal with other people and find love i relate so much i cringe at timesif you like louis check out lucky louie the original hbo series i also recommend maron it is a brilliant series from another comedy veteran just a little darker and more misanthropic,70,92,81,7,5

yes tests do mean something to me but more as a means to narrow down your type rather than something that is a definitive answer to what your type is what they actually tend to accomplish is quite remarkable for the most part as the study of typology is very complex to get anywhere near a correct answer by taking a online test that takes twenty minutes and has about a 7080 accuracy is nothing to totally dismiss but it does take careful study and a fair amount of self awareness to confirm the results im not a big fan of the idea of domtert loops as i think what actually goes on when they seem to appear isnt quite that simple i dont think you can just cut out your extroverted functions like that even if they arent being used appropriately and that more often than not your tertiary is going to be contaminated by your inferior what is considered a cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention loop is more along the lines of relitigating your past and not letting go of unhealthy elements of the past or just giving up on trying new things in order to stay in your comfort zone when used positively cogfuncmention in the tertiary position is more like childlike nostalgia another important point when it comes to the tertiary is that it is a function that you tend to be mostly unaware of and in my opinion tertiary cogfuncmention is going to develop before cogfuncmention out of necessity in our modern times i think that going through 18 years of formal education is going to force development of the thinking function more than a similar function of perception with this is mind most inxps tend to be very out of touch with the inner workings of their body and their own energy levels until later in life once theyve established a workaround for their cogfuncmention deficiencies i think that both types want others to understand the world but i think that typemention are going to be less inclined to do so the problem here with typemention other than thinking that most people are incapable of understanding certain things are going to be less capable of expressing what they know expression comes from the extroverted judging functions which would be inferior cogfuncmention here typemention can develop a frustration with helping others understand things because once theyve built up that model it can become so complex that they dont really know where to begin to explain something and when they do they are prone to skipping a bunch of steps and not explaining it well at all thus further frustrating them and giving up on sharing their knowledge in that sense i think that typemention tend to get intellectually disillusioned and only start to share their inner knowledge with those they are close and comfortable with or after theyve become somewhat of an expert on a particular subject the thing is though is that teaching others is probably the best way for an typemention to understand a subject as it forces them to organize their thoughts and express them lower level cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention a fair amount of these things could also apply to an typemention but i think there are some differences here i think that an typemention would probably be a more effective teacher as they are more capable of paying attention to details and are probably more capable of relating to others and expressing themselves clearly i think that they would be more driven towards the expression of their ideas as well since cogfuncmention serves as a mobilizing function to cogfuncmention,70,92,81,7,5
i have that at home i build my own machines with linux compatibility in mind and it is smooth sailing if hardware is not known to work with linux or known to work poorly i just dont buy it when it comes to laptops i avoid nvidia i avoid older broadcom networking chips and i avoid the newer intel atoms horrible linux support in my experience lenovo thinkpads are the most trouble free laptops for running linuxdoes that mean that i cant run out and just buy the first thing that tickles my fancy yes it means exactly that i have to research first if hardware will even work with linux do i wish that was better yes do i expect that to happen eventually another decade or two yes that is a weak point with linux but one that is outside of its influence sphere and a long standing one if hardware vendors are not willing to support linux with open specifications or an open driver that hardware will be a pain under linuxstill linux as a whole is still the best operating system for me so i accept its weaknesses because these are far outpaced by its strong points,30,31,21,17,17

your stance of doing well and losing is sugar coating everything this sugar coating of the truth is why losing teams get trophys now days people afraid to be blunt and honest because people are too sensitive to the truth and sugar coating the truth like this does no one any favors if you tell a losing team they still performed well theyll make no effort to improve themselves better to hit them with the cold blunt truth that they lost because they didnt perform well so that improvements can be made im sorry you dont understand this for the same reason young male athletes look up to professional male athletes lmao yeah right the men got paid 9million for losing in the 16th round while the womens team got paid 2million for winning the championshipif the women were being paid respectively to their skill level they should have been paid more than the mensince the women are national champions that is not the solution,89,59,95,7,43

then it doesnt really solve it i meanhonestly i dont feel the need of this that op describedmaybe my fake world is a holistic view on the universe and the world where everyone is equally important including myselfmaybe that the problem that you actually dont feel important enough in your view of the world which bounces you back to the view of being overly important for humanity world etc to compensate it so to speak hmmi think my thing is acceptance and not importance which actually could be the same thing but viewed from a different angle cos if you crave like you said public speaking or any kind of a spotlight you basically want ppl to find you important so you feel importance of youself through others ppl opinion about yourself acceptance by others is a similar thing in a way where you put yourself out and want others to evaluate you yea we accept you no we dont accept you maybe it could be looked on in a sense of you are important enough for us or dont it kinda the same rejection or not thing in a case of importance you virtually got rejected cos you arent important so yea it could be a slightly different angle of the same thing ghmm but im more inclined towards serving and helping ppl rather than to wish to be in a spotlight do public speaking etc it doesnt matter that much for me,40,98,1,1,83

cogfuncmention is extraverted feeling its the third function in our stack of netifesi supposedly the first two functions neti are what we use primarily to think and navigate the world we learn to supplement these two over time with the third function and then the fourth we do not ever achieve the same proficiency or preference for using the third and fourth functions and can find it tiring to use them at length this is opposed to using your first two functions which actually energizes you either in the presence of others if you are an extrovert or alone if you are an introvert cogfuncmention is all about detecting the feels of others wanting to make those feels positive and then doing so cogfuncmention is concerned with the well being of the group often over the well being of the individual its politics and kumbaya,15,85,15,85,15

its relative to what you know then you need logic to compare facts and get some true relatively true image of whats up i guess i dont like fakeness and trueness of things is one of my inner values so i prefer ideas about things to be adequate to the reality rather than to be delussional well you can say absolute truth is unreachable therefore everything you know is fake which is kindof right from the philosophical view but things arent that black and white either absolute truth or absolute fake anyways its just words and you can juggle them around and put various meaning and context in it this is truth not that is truth whatever manyou dont really agree with what i initially said and how i described it by the truth i didnt really mean a philosophical category truth with capital t but rather was just pointing out that i prefer things to be as true as possible to a certained degree in a sense of what actually is going so there i need a logical verification to pursue that initial cogfuncmention value of trueness which is quite idealistic in its root tbh,40,98,1,1,83

textbook typemention behaviour right there you explained it pretty well quite a few psychologists have looked into this or variations of it eg milgram zimbardo thorndike pavlov etc im a flaired user over raskhistorians im planning to do a panel ama about the history of psychology its implications applications and ramifications for history amp modern society entitled delving into the psyche so look out for that no worries thats what we typementions are here for quite a few people like ancient greek philosophy but not me i quite like modern stuff as i mentioned amp presocratic philosophy the philosophers that look at what is colour how can water be the basis for all things etc if youre interested id suggest watching this oxford university lecture on philosophy from the presocratics to the modern day enjoy,86,45,25,59,67

the alternative is that people get to share in the benefits of automation by owning robots i envision two policies here first government sponsored loansgrants for acquisition of robots for the public second making sure ai and robotics remain in the public domain we have to make it very very accessible for everyoneso instead of depending on ubi people would be able to provide for themselves in order to make people more independent new technologies such as solar energy and 3dprinting will also play a roleubi seems to me to be inherently unstable if power is concentrated at the top and they decide a stipend to give to each person that would put the population in a position of dependence also forced equality with no social mobility doesnt sit well with the public and i wouldnt like to see an endgame where google and amazon own 80 of the profits from robotics and the rest of the world depends on state welfare better to spread the automation as much as possible and avoid it falling in the hands of just a few corporations,57,90,21,15,43

even then id like statistics from this or last yearthose are far more relevant than you think for example the rise in criminality in europe the refugee crisis terrorist attacks etcalso what is wrong in judging the situation and safety for the future on current events just because x happened in 2014 doesnt mean x would happen also tomorrowand there are 9 months between conceiving a child and its birth since you cant predict the future for conflicts on the global scale just on statistics but more likely on current events i stand by my opinion that 19902001 was safer from the global situation for europe and the west than now,46,27,31,10,84

here is quote from one the letter which i think illustrate the failure to understand trumps supporters by the leftpsychologists jonathan haidt study how conservatives and liberals value things differently he identified 5 core values he talk about it in this ted talk notably conservatives value ingroupoutgroup thinking higher than liberalsthe clinton campaign did a focus group to understand why people are voting for trump people answer was he is an asshole but he is our asshole people can pretend to have transcended ingroupoutgroup thinking but the fact is even if they think they do they dont people operate following ingroupoutgroup thinking even if they think they dont the above quote divide the world in two side the richs and the poors then in the next breath contradict itself with a vague statement about togethernessone letter start with my father is muslim another says trump is part of the elite another says im german they are all identities people think in identities thats human nature sure we can wish people would transcend that but those people havent nor do ipeople on the left want to pretend they have transcended identity the reality is they have simply abandoned old larger identities to replace them by new smaller ones and valued only a subset of those while demonizing some others this is why it came to be called identity politicsonce upon a time there used to be this concept called america im canadian but i can recognize the value of the american identity it meant something to be american for many this identity started to be demonized for good or bad reasons now people are flying mexicans flags and burning the american ones when protesting trump being white is associated with shame being male and heterosexual is associated with privileges being christian make you backward being all four make you literally hitler unless people make an effort to understand the reality of identities and recognize that trump supporters are being affirming their owns notably the american identity and unless people are willing to meet them with a shared pride the dialogue will remains one of hostility a fight between competing identities but it will be the fourth of july soon a day of pride for many many of those who will fly the american flag on that day many of those are trump supporters if you are american or living in america you can fly an american flag in company of a trump supporter share their pride and experience a moment of togetherness because thats what people want to feel we are in this together,39,89,1,22,61

as an typemention who has blatantly committed crimes at the felony level i can tell you it took only the motivation that they deserved it and greatest likelihood of not getting caught that enabled me to actin fact i was caught once after assaulting a guy that committed an act of animal cruelty and successfully defended myself against 5 charges at least one was a felony level this was on fort bragg and in a military court martial so not civilian courtso anger and fear are not the only motivators,19,84,7,12,27

phew glad i spotted thisheating your tank can be done using a undertank heater uth these are those black pads with adhesive sides that you stick to the bottom of the tank to heat it up these can get very very hot and must be used with a thermostat i use paper towels to insulate against them anyway so my snake never has direct contact with itthat being said heat bulbs should only be used to raise ambient air temperatures but it is only effective to a certain extent a better method of raising the ambient air temperature would be a ceramic heater bulb these do a better job at heating up to a certain temperature consistently without giving out any extra red lightif you do have any heat bulbs humidity will be an issue for you as these dry out the air very effectively so be sure to keep an eye on that,45,69,26,0,28

there is very little information out there about the original conception of the enneagram outside of a few sources if you want to check out what the enneagram is really all about look into the founder gurdjieff his students ospensky and especially more modern interpretations of jg bennett and anthony blake i just did a subreddit search of renneagram for gurdjieff and only found three mentions of the founder of the enneagram that is very weird mbti departs quite a ways from the original jung but the modern understanding of the enneagram is so much further removed from its source or original intent the enneagram of process is really about so much more than just a system of typology it can basically be used to describe how all processes occur,70,92,81,7,5

these activist types shouldnt assume that a homeless dog is not being taken care of by anyone or that it isnt happywe have a homeless dog living near our apartment building we call her girl everyone loves girl and feeds her gives her water and pets her in winter time when it is especially cold a neighbor lady takes her in the house yet girl doesnt have a proper owner but she is so happy she sometimes accompanies my daughter from home to school of her own volition its not like she gets something for it she does it out of pure love and friendshipor course its ok for a dog to live outside in fact i feel more sorry for the dogs with owners in my apartment they have less freedom and see less sun,57,90,21,15,43

ive been on both ends of this being a performer orchestra and bringing my students with various disabilities to movies plays etc personally i would start my kids out slow and see what they could handle go to the afternoon movie matinee then maybe a small high school play or bandorchestra performance we might do social stories and practice our appropriate performance behavior i hope the parent did not bring their child to a 3 hour broadway production for their first show that said any time any kid could vocalize a kid with autism may be more likely to vocalize in a way that is unfamiliar in sound and may agitate some folks it is the parents discretion and responsibility whether or not it is appropriate to remove them immediately as far as adults we arent perfect either there is always one that claps between movements edit a word,57,80,86,79,55

violet chewed on the underside of her lip unsure whether to open up any further so far all her openness had earned her was another stressful lesson and a seemingly disappointed sigh yet in spite of her less than forthcoming nature violet trusted her father deeply if he claimed that sharing and explaining her problems was the responsible thing to do she believed him and that proved to be enough to tip the scales once againits just so confusing violet complained after her bout of deliberation a serious frown lining her lips sometimes i get them confused or i forget or they look not the same or they move sometimes its all that,20,61,7,54,19

to me it feels like immense jealously towards you because of a perceived failure on his side to get that job followed by rationalization of behaviour he knows is stupid and irrational by suddenly being proamerican capatilism antisocialism and all the other out of the blue things hes saying about europethe netherlandsi think you need to sit down with him and simply say straight to his face you are behaving like crap and youre acting like a child we made this decision together and you need to get your act straight this is going to happen i am going there whether you like it or not with or without youi dont think with this behaviour that any subtle steering of his behaviour will have any effect,2,92,31,60,53

i have to be careful not to sound like a stalker when i talk about memories with people i can package a lot of data into a single memory file so its like yeah remember it was that one time when we went to florida and we were lost in south beach so we went to a sports bar with a striped awning and sat outside because it was too smokey inside and people were watching baseball and you were wearing that white sweater and we noticed the fancy house that had all that security and realized it was versaces and he had just recently been murdered and we ate that mushroom marsala pasta that was the best italian we had eaten in years and then later we talked about breadfruit and their significance in sea traveland theyre like that was over 20 years ago why do you even remember all that all that imagery and emotion and detail is linked and when i bring up one thing it all starts coming back to me the thing is i often dont have it immediately available but once i access deep storage its all there conversations sensory data emotional overtones everything ive found people prefer if your memory is as hazy as theirs some dont like it if they know you can remember a version of them that they cant or that they dont want to,83,80,46,37,14

the other ladies gave a bunch of great responses i 100 agree with its interesting to see how other typemention ladies feel the same like me about having a friend to come home to someone relaxed who will be honest with you and keep you grounded no emotional games or drama just being able to come home be home and leave all your stress at the door which also means your so doesnt make an issue of your work and career is really just chill about it and everything else concerning our overly ambitious characters i find this interesting because this type of man arent usually the overly ambitious guys like we are at least not to the same level and intensity as we are it balances us out i guess but for some reason i still have a stereotypical idea in my head about us strong typemention women belonging in some kind of power couple relationship with an equally ambitious man i realize now after so much time with my more laidback so that wouldnt make me happy though,50,85,50,85,50

i sort of borrowed the idea from the steiner waldorf tradition where its common to put the wise men at the far end of the house on christmas morning and move them a little closer every day until epiphanyi like observing advent and the twelve days of christmas we have advent candles our tree doesnt go up until christmas eve and we take it down on the day after epiphany we dont do christmas presents because we feel that can easily become a distraction from what is for us a religious feast instead we celebrate st nicholas the kids get a book each and epiphany the kids get chocolate coins in their shoes to bookend the festival season with small gifts we also play the appropriate bach cantatas and other sacred music throughout,2,98,88,0,20

im going to piggyback of of uyahrabiess incredibly insightful comment but from the other sideas someone who came from a pretty poor family and then was cut off by them while in collegefirst i dont want to act like i know about your experience with people in your life you may very well have been unlucky enough to meet a significant number of poorer people who resented you for your parents having money however as someone who might have been perceived as holding that resentment the thing that prevented me from being really close to anyone who was rich and from my perspective anything upwards of 40000 was rich was never for the obvious results of having moneyfor having nice cars for going on nice vacations for the jewelry or the holidays it was more like i and wealthy people didnt speak the same languageimagine that youre trying to speak with someone who speaks a language that you dont if youre an asshole you might be pissed at them for their existence being inconvenient to you but more often than not youll just be frustrated by the situation you can only relate over the most basic concepts they might seem to say one thing and actually mean another ultimately you dont pursue the connection not because you think theyre a bad person or because you dont have anything in common but because the communicative hurdle is just too massiveim going to expand on an actual example of how this affected my friendships have you ever gotten a text from a significant other that reads we need to talk or kept checking your phone because your grandfather is in surgery and no one knows if hell make it then you know what real dread feels like that sickening hollow feeling in the pit of your stomach there was about half a year there where i felt like that but constantly three days a week i had stress nausea and could hardly eat because between work and school and trying to hold my life together my life was so precarious that a flat tire at the wrong time could have made me drop out of school i suffered from the symptoms for ovarian cysts but just had to grit my teeth pop some ibuprofen hope desperately that if one burst it would be on the left side because if its on the left i could just stay home feeling miserable for two or three days but if its on the right i would have to go into the hospital because it might be appendicitis instead and the difference is life and deathso who was i going to hang out with you cant keep that level of stress under wraps at least i couldnt and middleclass kids and richer couldnt really get it they were of course wellintentioned and caring but telling them what was going on in my life even the things that didnt seem like such big problems and expecting them to relate was like asking a fish to climb a tree it was the other kids who were living on ramen and working their way through college who got it the language we spoke to each other was this sucks and were trapped but one day well be freei never hated anyone for having money i envied that they didnt have to live with my fears i never wanted their cars or their single dorm rooms or their fancy clothes i wanted a weekend night off so i could go to chillis with my friends,0,38,43,77,12

its a little vague but offering to take someone out does kind of imply that youre treating them if you say lets go to or we should go to sometime then its not implying any such thingon the other hand if you were on the other side id tell you its pretty foolish to expect the other party to pay i once had a guy i was crushing on say i should take you to sometime that wording of course set off all my radars because i was like whoa he wants to take me on a date no he didnt he mightve been flirting but nothing ever happened i still cant say for sure what he meant but contextually from the whopping nothing that ever happened between us im pretty sure he just wasnt thinking about his wording and basically meant you should try going there sometimemaybe ill go with youjust think about your wording more carefully next time you mightve implied it but you didnt guarantee anything and i think itd be silly of the other couple to expect that unless youre super rich or something,70,45,20,24,40

its not really a problem with management who are deciding on who to hire actually many european universities have policies in place which highly favour women in stem fields to a point you may very well say its discriminating although yes these fields usually have less then 20 women in any scientific position thats higher than a post doc level my own university has research institutes that have none actually this actually causes problems with regard to work environment and providing role models for students so why are there so little women in academia no science to back this up but my own experiences tell me that many women actually want to be in academia as the number of female phd students is actually quite high maybe not 5050 yet for engineering in my country but still quite good however when you want your career to progress in academia you need to be able to handle the work load and stress that comes with really devoting your life to your research and you are also required work abroad for multiple years before getting being able to become a professor at least in europe if you want a position at a decent university after you get in at an assistant professor level it is still a very competitive environment everything is measured the amount of phds you have how much grant money you bring in citation indexes and number of papers everything you want to become an associate professor sure go ahead if you meet the minimum requirements you want to be full professor well we only have room for 1 full prof for every 23 associates and really if you are not good enough to be a full prof most universities kick you out eventually because there are assistant professor waiting to take your spot which have more potential worklife balance in academia is absolutely awful and i believe this is the reason why there are so little women in academia however once you get in which is also something i personally experienced you are very much respected and treated as equal well some of the computing science and physics men in their men cave offices need to be told to store away their nude calendar posters once they have a female phd joining them but thats about it,2,92,31,60,53

as a girl who is now studying to be an engineer and has had first hand experience with being discriminated against my stem interests from ever since i was about 7 years old no girls are actively pushed away from stem by society by their peers family and even teachers the only reason i got into stem is because my father was my big advocate and called everyone out who tried to tell me stem isnt for girls why dont you choose a social science instead youre probably not good enough at mathematics anyway to be an engineer if you go to an engineering or physics department at your local uni youll find most of the girls there have similar stories,50,85,50,85,50

one of the big differences between cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention and cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention is how one perceives the physical world and particularly objects cogfuncmention users are going to perceive the sensory world objectively or as it is from there they attach subjective abstract ideas about the object in plain english the object has value that anyone can see or at least they think so and that object says something about the individual the motivation behind the stereotype that cogfuncmention users value shiny objects is what is important for example everyone knows that the bigger the diamond or the nicer the car the more value it objectively has and that says something about the person that owns it your possessions deliberately say something about you as a person they are a sort of status symbol even if they not expensive or if the individual isnt materialistic now contrast this to how an cogfuncmention user views objects for an cogfuncmention user an object has no inherent value on its own it is all subjective this object has value because it is useful for the user they do not particularly care if anyone else in the world sees it as valuable the value of an object is created over time as the object proves to be more useful or is associated positive experiences this is why to an cogfuncmention user a new object is worth less when brand new than it is when it is had for a while value is extracted from the object rather than attached to it they may appreciate shiny objects just as much as the next guy but will more likely have a subjective idea of what it is actually worth for example a diamond may be objectively worth x amount of dollars subjectively for me it is worth very little ill take into consideration that the diamond market is rigged the whole blood diamond thing that i dont want to support its low resale value etc but most importantly is it x amount of dollars of usefulness no now maybe if this same diamond was a family heirloom or represented something important to me it would have a totally different subjective value that you really couldnt put a price onso when typing yourself look at some of your favorite possessions and consider why they are important to you also keep in mind that the judging functions will come into play here for example with lower level cogfuncmention you may dress a certain way in order to conform to societal expectations or to distance yourself from those expectations these drives may override your desire dress like a princess or a bag lady because youd take into consideration what it appropriate with cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention the differences in expression are going to be subtler to discern than if you were torn between typemention and typemention but should nonetheless should be possible if not i didnt even get into cogfuncmention vs cogfuncmention really so there are many other aspects that can help you narrow it down,70,92,81,7,5

first of all if youre going to spend real money it should probably be on stashes youre going to get overloaded with crap you want to keep for later and youll have nowhere remotely close to enough room to store it alli have purchased g the currency you buy with real money once because it gave me a ridiculously huge store discount like 80 off anything i buy with g so i picked up a couple stashes otherwise ive been exclusively free to playand ive gotten i think 21 characters unlocked i did deadpool first as all his abilities are free no spiritspell pointswhatever cost and hes got a good mix of ranged attacks regen aoe teleportation and melee my second was scarlet witch because she can just lay waste to large areas without having to get messy since then ive found ones that i enjoy playing more but it just depends on what youre looking for they all seem good unless youre elitist and looking at endgame content my favorite right now is kitty pryde even though im not generally a fan of melee characters just because she slices right through everything and her ability to phase through walls is very handythere are a ton of stats and items and weird currencies you pick up in the game lots of stuff you need 1200 bobs burritos or whatever random stuff like omega access files or cosmic worldstones or whatever to buy from a specific vendor but there are usually events going on that drop massive amounts of loot so picking that stuff up goes pretty quick sadly the one area where the game is completely lacking in depth is the gameplay some of the animations are great some characters feel really fluid with their movements but to me it seems like i can keep it on easy mode and its way too easy or bump the difficulty up just one notch and now the little food minions that i used to oneshot without ever taking damage can kill me if im not careful there doesnt seem to be much at all in the way of strategy other than avoiding the instakill moves like rhinos charge attack holding down left mouse button and cycling through the toofew keyboard shortcuts you can assign to powersthe voice acting is pretty darn good for the most part and as shallow as the gameplay is its still somewhat addictivei definitely recommend playing each character to level 10 to get a feel for who you like movement abilities are important as teleports and walking through walls or even a really high leap like captain americas will be extremely useful on a lot of missions you get one character of your choice for free after that they cost eternity splinters a few are only 200 the rest are 400 or 600 but you can also unlock a random one for 175 at the eternity splinter vendor the risk there is that it can give you one you have already unlocked in which case you get a token to advance that characters ultimate by one level insteadeternity splinters are the one ingame currency that doesnt get dumped on you frequently youll get one every 8 minutes or so and sometimes an event or boost or loot chest will let you get 4 or 5 at a time but usually its the slow 75ish per hour pace eternity splinters which i dont know if you can even buy outright and stash space are the only things id consider paying money for,25,71,49,17,45

im not sure canada is the answer i know a canadian who live here in australia and she said that its just as expensive as australia which is on the same level as norway and switzerland however australians have the salaries to match it with the average job paying about 75000 and a good job is being at least 100000 whereas canadians dont she said an average salary is 40000 a year and a good job would get you 60000 audcad is 11furthermore canadians have the same problems with housing as the uk does a house in a decent place with those good jobs as above ie toronto vancouver calgary is just as expensive as australia and se englandif you want to move somewhere for a better life id also recommend the usa in addition to australia cost of living is absurdly low there you can still get a 400k 1 bed apartment in manhattan and pay is among the highest in the world for white collar jobs on par with australia if you have a university degree and are skilledcertified in something the main difference is that theres a hugely visible underclass in the usa who have it really tough and are exploited by companies like walmart but if youre in that sort of position you wouldnt meet the eligibility criteria to move there yes theres no free healthcare either but your employer usually pays for insurance on top of your salary and even if you have to fund it yourself the lower taxes plus tons of deductions more than make up for it anyway,45,92,54,62,9

right could you describe that in terms of basic principles or clearly define your idea of deservedness force and how someone earns things all i can solidly tell from that is you dont believe in determinismnot trying to be pedanticpicky here its just that youve clearly learned how to argue in a debatepolitics framework and seem to be making claims that are sufficiently ambiguous that any objection to them can be countered by refining your definitions which obscures your principles and any ability to really counter or agree with you intentional or notim interested in what kind of principles you hold to be true and how they logically lead to your conclusions so im trying to sidestep all of that personally i see concepts of deservednessresponsibility as either incoherent or morally redundant likewise with the idea of earning something etc so id like to see how you would come to use those terms consistently and nonarbitrarily,2,85,2,86,30

tough question depend on your definition of eq reallyi for example am really good at reading people i notice small changes in body language and speech immediately and instinctively know whether thats why someone is sad or is trying to deceive me for example i also very very quickly get a feeling for someones character when i meet new people in this sense i have very high eqbut this is the thing i adjust my own way of speaking pose and tone of voice to match whatever i want from that person based on what i read of them but doing so is honestly a very rational decision to be honest i really lack empathy i only experience real empathy with my dearest friends close family and my so so from this perspective my eq is shitefor example if my employee would come to me with a crisis situation a dying mother for example i would be super concerned in tone of voice and body language i would do anything to accommodate them to arrange things but this is because i want my employee and team to function best which is when they feel safe with me as their employer and safe in their job environment a stressed out employee is useless and will take the whole team down better to give them some time off to get their life back in order ill find a way to manage until then thats my job anyway but honestly i couldnt care less about the dying family member per se i simply feel nothing no sadness or any other empathic feelings,93,30,40,12,67

its this attitudethat doesnt fit with reality the human has an internal drive to do things and would desire new things or even invent work just to keep himself amused what do you think unemployed people would do just drop on the couch open the tv and sit there until they die no people would be active regardless of their employment status not only people would have time and desire to do things they would have the best resources at their disposal too cloud computing ondemand fabbing automation open designs solar energy and batteries all of these would empower people to do something at the minimum any family should supervise a garden the upbringing of their children and the constructionmaintaining of their house so there they have something to do people dont need ubi when they can rely directly on automation we had mostly self sustaining farms and villages up until a few decades we can still do iti think people will organize and form social networks of skilled professionals small companies and communes that would farm land produce tools and provide healthcare education food and living space for its members since there will be many unemployed the incentive to organize and do something about it would be great what we should strive for is to empower self reliance and make sure self reliant people and communities are not blocked by ip rights oppressive regulation or other hurdles society will turn inwards become less dependent on remote production and global trade almost everything can be done locally and almost any community should be able to be self sustained and not need external help,57,90,21,15,43

according to this hard sci fi deals with natural sciences and soft sci fi deals with social sciences most of the sci fi ive read does not fall exclusively into one category or the other as one would expect after all the social aspects of life are heavily influenced by the natural environment i think northlands central premise that what happens in the world is primarily influenced by the physical environment in this case the ebb and flow of the polar ice puts it in the hard sci fi category without spoiling the story its basically a what if scenario what if an ancient culture had managed to modify their environment so significantly as to alter the history of civilisation and even for a time the weather there is no magic which would disqualify it from being fantasy in some peoples eyes although i personally find alternative history quite acceptable as fantasy,2,98,88,0,20

i mean i dont really know what its supposed to mean when someone describes a human artefact as being a work of an mbti function which are themselves sort of bastardisations of jungs functions like either you are talking about the thought process or intuition that created them which i think someone would have to do a lot of research to be maybesortof qualified to interpret i think trying to analyse creativity is way stretching the proper bounds of mbti anyways like every word carries a ton of weight i think you would at least need to read italian which maybe you do but assuming you read it in english something with layers and layers of truth has all the more to lose due to being lost in translation ythe closer language gets to the ineffable the more peculiar and precarious and untranslateable it gets i mean ive read about 7 translations of iliad and still dont think i understand it because i dontthe impulse to simplify and explain via unitary processes is at work here like someone who knows a bit about mbti and nothing about the old testament might read it and say oh this is clearly a work of cogfuncmention ie a term used to describe thought processes of a singular person but in light of the reality the the ot was composed by a multitude of authors and edited by another multitude who would probs all score differently on mbti and mutated across time and thru successive generations that explanation doesnt make sense unless you think mbti scales up and entire societies have type which they dontof course we know la divina commedia very much is the work of a single man with unitary vision but you get my point what function is guernica a work ofaltho i have before described kants critique of pure reason as the work of an unbridled pathological cogfuncmention working unchecked for 12 years which is i think how long it took him to write that which makes a little sense because cognition is something he talks about i mean he kind of describes human cognition in a very very complicated way in a similar way to how mbti describes cogfuncmention in a very very simple way ie projects the process of a cogfuncmentiondom onto cognition itself kind of explains why everyone hates it if they didnt get that far they hate it for different reasonswhether youre aware of it or not youre using an alteration of the term lisztomania to describe the popular allure mainly amongst the ladies of the great romantic and first rockstar franz liszt as is beatlemania obviously in a nice touch of jungian synchronicity here is one of his more epic compositions,38,86,10,3,69

to me i agree with your description of tennis shoes flat white shoes like a nurse might wear super casual and comfy but not good for running around i know theyre actually basketball shoes but chuck taylors are kind of what i think of when i think tennis shoes but gym shoes and sneakers are synonymous running shoes or walking shoes or any comfy casual shoe you could wear to do sports in is a gym shoe your typical nike or adidas or whatever,70,45,20,24,40

1 sun and moon had the most cinematic story yet with a wide range of interesting characters the only major problem is the protagonists facial expression2 black and white presented an interesting moral dilemma although team plasma seemed a little too comically evil for this to work perfectly the characters were very interesting and the climax actually taking place at the end of the main story was nice3 omega ruby and alpha sapphire these remakes really fleshed out the characters and improved the story and it added the delta episode tooif were including spinoffs then pokemon mystery dungeon explorers of sky would take the cake but i havent played super mystery dungeon yet,78,62,61,15,38

i dont think youre being manipulative controlling maybe not you specifically but high cogfuncmention users generally including myself but i dont see manipulative youre trying to explain how you feel and think and see the situation and everyone is shitting all over it and assuming youre lying in order to control the situation or something its happened to me and its frustrating as hell because i literally only want to get on the same page as people its just that my version of being on the same page involves never calling people retards when we disagree and others feel differently,50,85,15,50,85

although yes good programmes are selective the selection process is by far less intimidating compared to the us in europe doing a masters degree after a bachelor is more or less the minimum expectation of many employers instead of a thought through career choice as it usually is in the us because of this almost everyone who has done a bachelors degree reasonably well will find themselves a spot in a masters programme the selection they usually put in place is only to cut of the bottom percentages but not to select only the top percentages of course not including oxbridge etcwhat would be the average gpa of your fellow students is your university somewhere top 150 or even top 100 in the world ranking in my experience in the case of us universities the quality of the university determines a lot of your chances as there simply is a far broader range of quality and depth to them in europe most governments govern education quality extremely strict so any university in a specific country will not differ much in quality from the other ive had family members for example go to us colleges and return home only to find out their diplomas couldnt be converted to university level dutch diplomas but only applied science diplomas this is because according to the government the education quality of those specific uniscolleges did not line up with the quality the government expects from our unis,50,85,50,85,50

yeah she brought it up but in a way that really pissed me off actually she was like youre not reaching out much and when you do all you talk about is being sick um cause my whole life is being sick what do you want me to talk about should i be working on entertaining you while im sick we then had a call at her request and she was like i need to know whats up with you and i think she wanted me to profess my love or something but i was still figuring out where i was at with the whole thing all i knew is that i really enjoyed her company we had epic physical chemistry and i respected her but i didnt know what i wanted and i wasnt in love wed only been dating for a few weeks but ya know idealists tend to have very specific visions for how people should feel in the beginning the thing is i cant fall for something i dont understand and i didnt really know her yet anyways i texted more but was still kind of sick i tried to make plans with her asap but neither of us had complementary openings huehuehue until like a week and a half after that point the night before she called me up with the whole line about anxiety over seeing me i was like yo why cant we just hang out and see how it feels if it feels friendly we can do that but i think it will feel like more nope i offered friendship then and she agreed but left the ball in her court to reach out and i dont think she ever will which is a shame,15,85,15,85,15

i do think cs would be one of the degrees that is doable at b2 the fact that youve been b2 before you spent some time there a few years ago may does not say anything b to c level is the biggest step to make in language learning many get stuck on b2 because you need to really get some immersion going on or active dailyevery other day training to get from b2 to c1 so unless you have being working at it actively youd probably still be at b2with cs youll also have no problem finding a job in europe and if not in francce you can move to belgium also bilingual frenchdutch for example i live in the netherlands and most of the cs students at my uni are picked up by companies way before they graduatei think whats important now is for you to figure out the visa application process considering i read below you dont have uk nationality only ancestry visa and to contact several of the unis youre interested in and see if they would do an informal assessment of your diplomas to see if you have a good chance of being admitted,93,30,40,12,67

from my own experience so totally anecdotal at those younger ages it was my mother a couple of aunts and uncles and a teacher who would push me away from stem while my dad was incredibly supportive of it i clung on to my dad who taught me to stand up for my self and be proud of my interests its not black and white but more like a tug of war and such events could have helped me and my dad by getting me in touch with girls with similar interests so i would have an easier time knowing i was indeed not the weird one of the bunch i by the way agree that we will never reach a 5050 split in most professions and thats ok with me but right now you see that in many cases there is a 1090 split in disciplines such as engineering and nursing this will never be 5050 but i do believe we are missing out on talent even if its just a few male engineers whod rather get into nursing and a few female nurses who want to get into engineering but decided otherwise due to social pressure etc i think thats my bottom line even if the percentages dont change getting rid of the social pressure on men and women is still a valuable thing to society,46,27,31,10,84

and if you think trump isnt going to do the same exact things then yeah youre delusionalno obama wasnt perfect a ton of people on the left have criticized him fairly harshly if you didnt see that you were staying in your little conservative bubble and most of the things you just mentioned arent liberal vs conservative theyre complex things that i cant even begin to fathom on how difficult it must be to make those decisions theyve got a shitload more intel than we do obama was no different than any other president in that regard not by much anyway if you expect trump isnt going to do the same kind of shit i dont know what to tell you thats not bias thats a politicians fucking job and its not as easy as it sounds trump is going to learn that very very quicklyi dont agree with a lot of what the nsa does and im not happy about the debt either one thing i hope trump does accomplish is bringing that back downthe president doesnt have nearly as much power as people tend to think obama has congress working against him trump on the other hand is going to get a lot of what he wantstrump is not the devil or evil incarnate as i previously stated he was the republican i agreed with most policywise yes there are things he plans to do that i agree with its not as black and white as you make it out to be but i do not think he is qualified and i think he is a despicable human being who does not know how to act in public and is powerhungryall of which are awful qualities in a president he also lacks most of the most important qualities id much rather have a republican president that i disagree with more but can actually respect and wont embarrass our nationand way to not actually address any of my points and accusing me of being on a soapbox then just continuing on your own soapbox,70,45,20,24,40

an older statsbomb article which kind of goes over why tackles and interceptions alone dont really say much i would recommend googling statsbomb defense if you want to read more of the metrics theyve tried to use to judge defensethere really arent many good defensive statistics out there is patch from deepxg which is the only one i can think of off the top of my head in my opinion the best way to measure a defender right now is using goalimpact which doesnt actually measure any defensive contribution but they keep their numbers mostly secret as they want to make money from it its also not a perfect stat and can overunderrate some players based on the team they play for,83,69,27,39,8

it is possible in dota 2 if they use around the same netcode and protocols as csbecause of the rendering technique urakijah has explained it to you already for ingame use ill explain it to you for external usecsgo sends information packets with information in them everyone gets these packets the players and the people on gotv although people on gotv get them delayed packets are structured in a specific way and contains information on the game state kinda like player1playernameteampositionxpositionypositionzfor xray as a spectator for example you need to get the coordinates of all players to display their position with the outline so the position data of all people will be sent to everyone on the server with each update every 015s on 64 and 007s on 128 tick as you may guess you have the position of all people then so all you have to do is to write a program that takes the packages and reads out the positions and displays them on the mapthe mm servers are 64 tick because 128 tick in mm is less beneficial for the larger number of players so why waste money on servers that give a huge advantage to one part of the playersi dont know how you get to say money issue but whateverthe community concepts are giving a single person too much power in this game for one part and for the other part are mostly ridiculous and not realisticthere was someone writing about encoding memory in games and decoding it as you need it the drawback is you need extremely powerful computers to do that and if such computers exist you can also cheat again so a lot is on the behalf of i wish there was a solution like xpeople are walling because they have fun cheating either they are not good enough and want to play easy mode or just want to ruin the games for others cheat coders like the challenge to write software that isnt detected or just to earn moneyyou wont get rid of these people in online games especially in fps as there is such a wide range of cheats you can create and usesomething you may want to read,50,85,15,50,30

yep especially for engineerings i think 90 or so gets their masters those 10 who dont do so because a university degree simply turned out to be too difficult for them or because of personal reasons really the only exception to this rule is compsci for which the demand is so astronomically big that companies have good offers ready for bachelor students and will further train them in house if youre thinking of doing chemeng in the netherlands i highly recommend getting your masters degree over here as well its two years tuition fees are about 14k a year for students outside of the us there are several options the technical universities but also the university of groningen the only nontechnical research university that offers engineering doing your masters over here will get you a diploma which employers will recognize youll get two years to learn the language a bit though this is not a requirement like it would be in germany or france and youll build a network so youll get a job quickly starting salaries are about 28003000 euros a month before taxes which puts you on average not even median which is far lower salary already at the start of your career for dutch wages just to put demand into perspective for chemengs,93,30,40,12,67

i play irelia fairly similar to jax and i have seen how masterchallengers deal with nasus basically you want him to push so that you can call jungle and murder him there are a few ways to do this but the one i like is to push early and trade with him as much as you can fight him over every cs for the first two waves use your resources and then recall now the turret resets the wave and he will be pushing dont tp back just walk to lane there will be a big wave freeze it he cant stop you from trimming the wave and freezing near your turret now its level 45 call jungle over kill him shove the wave back tp if he does and try to get another freeze going after doing this a couple of times you are strong enough to bully him off cs yourself you can also set up in the enemy jungle,34,21,82,74,20

well i see just about everything as being able to be related to typology and more so everyday cogfuncmention as a formal cause makes more sense to me than cogfuncmention aristotles definition is reminiscent of thomsons description of cogfuncmentionand further from her interpretation this all sounds like form to mei mentioned in my other comment the perception control theory i think that relates well to why the idea of information aspects is important it is for the sake of consistency but also explains what information we chose to focus on and how easy it is for us to metabolize certain aspects of information thus giving us our unique set of behaviors in response to this information aspect of information that we cannot effectively metabolize gives us a noticeable complex or a sort of indigestion in our metabolism in this sense it isnt really any different when you say that you are lactose intolerant than it is to say that you cant process art logical thought or connecting with someone emotionally you cant focus on the entirety of the informational stream so you gravitate towards what you are most accustomed to and translate what you struggle with into the domain of what you are i dont see any conflict with cogfuncmention as an information aspect being incongruous with the idea of the collective unconscious cogfuncmention in socionics is classified as global abstract pertaining to memory and archetypes temporal and thus also atemporal and timeless i would put in bold cogfuncmention types are more aware of reality with the emphasis on the marks objectivity is a fallacy everything is subjective and there is no escaping that by acknowledging your subjective bias you somewhat ironically become more objective in your perceptions what you dont know you have has you and i think that is one reason that viewing cogfuncmention as the most tuned to reality is a misconception,70,92,81,7,5

theres a difference between saying it was goodbad that this happened and he was rightwrong to do this â of course you can judge the worth of actions on their consequences but thats only one type of approach you see in philosophy theyre not necessarily the same querycould you it seems strange you posit that existence has inherent worth but only in its totality the universe but what if the universe were merely a mode of a higher category of being eg one of a multiverse transposing your logic up one cosmological level this would mean that the universe is no less inconsequential than the objects is contains think youd love nietzscheto quote him on the subject of goethe he advocated a kind of almost joyous and trusting fatalism faith that only in the totality everything redeems itself and appears good and justified such a faith however is the highest of all possible faiths i have baptized it with the name of dionysus this would entail a sort of moral nihilism indeed a contempt for moral concerns as almost petty,38,86,10,3,69

firstly what is the downside of stroking the ego of an unhinged narcissistmore importantlynot all narcissism is bad if he were a malignant narcissist all this time his children wouldnt adore and support him as they clearly do they much more likely would have cut off contact with him due to him being insufferable and someone doesnt just magically become a narcissist at 70 and at the precise moment when he decides to run against a democrat for the white houseand if he were delusional unhinged he would have lost all his money long ago a fool and his money are soon parted you might try to chalk it up to his advisors but delusional people ignore their advisors or choose advisors who dont know what theyre talking aboutyour unhinged narcissist meme doesnt pass the slightest common sense test its just a cudgel to use on people whose style repulses you or who offends your particular sensibilities,70,95,66,0,9

my parents have this combo so i can share a couple things ive observedas said elsewhere the more approval you can give the better theres a tendency for some not all typemention to assume that the other person knows about the appreciation they feel already because the typemention hasnt said otherwise the other person hasnt brought it up and the typemention is clearly devoted to the relationship for an typemention youll want to verbalize your feelings often they wont bring it up but theyll feel deeply unappreciated if you dont let them know theyre valuedon that note communication in general can be tricky with this pairing if the typemention isnt direct with their statements of opinion dont mistake that for uncertainty or ambivalence in that opinion they may feel strongly about what theyre tentatively sharing but they equally value harmony in the relationship talking it over before reaching a decision and the like so they wont always be direct if they arent sure youll agree on the flip side the typemention may take the typementions natural directness personally if it contradicts their deeply held opinions it works best when the typemention learns that directness improves communication and that disagreement is not the same thing as a fight for your part the best thing you can do to foster that is to avoid bluntly contradicting what they say ask them to explain what they mean value their opinion verbally and so on when they see that their environment is safe theyll eventually become direct enough that you can have clearer communication,70,33,46,6,33

thats because the zlist celebrities are on the bottom rung of the successful group they feel they have to prove themselves if that means acting bigger than they are but celebrities at the top dont need to prove themselves theyve already made it have statusmoney and after a certain period of time of being high status you focus more on the spiritual rather than the material,45,92,54,62,9
eren also pulled of annies moves in human form she taught them to himreigner not bertolt didnt know eren received that upgrade bottle and thought he learned it from scratchhe managed to crack the armor because he simply focused his own in one spot to make it thickerits highly implied that moving your titan body feels similar to moving your human body so him taking on annie was only impressive if you consider the opponent not if you look at how he movednone of your quick learning arguments hold upit is at best a feat of eren not of the attack titan,46,27,31,10,84

congrats people buy cheats for fps big newsthe main attraction of cs is the fact that is a highly competitive shooter with a pro scene not that you can cheat going by your logic everyone cheats because that is the reason they bought the gamealso your they are protected by valve shit 6 accounts a year for 7â that makes 42â profit or 005 keys for one person per day for a whole year market transactions are not factored in there i assume more people buy 005 keys per day over a year than cheaters buy new accountsyour math is way off the mark also is your complaint about vacgaben explained it in the post you linked as to why they wont make vac like the esea ac and i might add that eseas ac would lead to a cheater decline of roughly 1 if you look at mmget a clue before you talk and grow up,46,27,31,10,84

i personally prefer having single threads for questions every time you get different responses even from the same people i do though like the idea of having questions posted for discussion in the podcastvideo meeting i think having a set list of things to discuss could be a good time we could even invite people from other types to show what the interactions are like,15,85,15,85,15
skepticism eh i dont see how skepticism can be all that impressive in itself past the point where you realise as a kid that you can just keep asking why forever p probably true but people forget how much of reality really is invented by us why wouldnt it have an essential nature if it ultimately stems from ideas you should be able too look at reality and ultimately see the ideas behind itand essences dont have to be all that essential anyway in zen they say even the dharma itself is only a provisional truth or essence its esstentialness is ultimately relative,38,86,10,3,69

also a similar thing is the dao de jing credit given to lao zi lao tzu whatever here are links they are very similar to meditations more difficult to understand maybe because of language its in chinese so the english translation is not easy to understand also the chinese itself is not as gramatically similar to the chinese today so its just really odd but still has amazing ideas that to me at least are easily known without having to delve so far into their meaning the first two lines for example u9053u53efu9053u975eu5e38u9053u540du53efu540du975eu5e38u540du3002they have it as way that can be followed is not the unvarying way name that can be named is not the unvarying name what i find it to be is imagine way as ones life therefore the way that can be followed is not the common way to go therefore the name that can be named is not the common name for something in verse 2 it starts saying that when people think of this as beautiful and this as not they treat others differently that this different treatment is a cause for ugliness not the thing they treat differently i am always a little turned off by proequality things because they seem pretentious and annoying reading into it it is as simple as i have said it but when you might see it in act you can understand if you imagine it in act you can anyhow its a great way to learn a different language and its mechanics as well as a great lesson teacher so if you have time definitely opt for reading into it although it will press your brain,88,88,32,31,6

the truth is nothing so hurtful its untreatable only once a girl said to me you are just like your dad she knew i would never want to be considered this way but that was years ago and the only time a girlfriend hurt me like that this current one was going through some real problems with her ex and school and studying and felt like a huge failure for about a week last weektwo weeks ago so she said shed regretted saying she loved me but also regretted doing this and that and that and this so it didnt hurt only because i knew she was extremely stressed really i mean it didnt feel good but it didnt hurt and in your case that sounds hurtful honestly i mean i think she shouldnt have been mad and cold shouldered you for that but maybe you should have told her i mean still though thats the past,88,88,32,31,6

1 you probably know that most mbti tests are bs well the enneagram tests are 10 times more bs2 the 5 is mostly apathetic and neutralindifferent to most of these things the thing about here that makes it a 4 is that types 234 are all pretty much attention whores they all try to maintain a sense of image they feel that their image and sense of self is broken and they need validation to maintain their sense of self otherwise they will start feeling shame and thinking theyre worthless the 4 tries to make a tragedy out of everything so they can gain peoples attention all they want to is to be told theyre special and unique and some other edgy shit if you see any more of this edgy 4 behavior try to make them feel special it will really raise both of your moods here is a really good article about enneagram types under express their feelings preferring indirect methods to share and communicate what they feel fours spend a great deal of energy directing their selfimage inward fours are seeking their true identity and are trying to make sure that it is based on their inner feelings and imagination fours reject many of their positive qualities and common characteristics that they share with others its hard to be unique if you are like others fours seek attention through withdrawal which may at first seem like a contradiction fours withdraw to pull others in especially into their inner world they want others to notice their depth of character and to obtain sympathy for what they feel is their unjust suffering fours believe that life has dealt them a bad hand and their underlying feeling of shame may lead to hostility against life despair in addition they may feel hostility at their parents or others in their past themselves for being defective and at others for not recognizing how special the four is,3,74,4,46,92

if you want to protect information like cc personal info from browsing and stuff like that yes linux in a vm is a good way to go however your isp will still see 100 of everything that goes out you need to use an anonymous vpn and pay for one if you want to be better protected using a tor browser helps somewhat so if you dont want to pay you can try that outnot running a vm is always better performance wise but ive been using vmware for years and i quite enjoy it its how i was doing development for my job but mainly i would only use console and ssh into the vm to do it its just what i preferi run windows 10 on my main system and gentoo in vmware but you can install any distro you likei did also have a few machines at work that were native linux i never enjoyed the dual boot option though but if you care about performance you might want to go that routei hope that helps,9,61,13,4,72

in the post you replied to i quoted wikipedia for a definition of socialism i agree with there are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them are you even reading my posts what possible reason could you have to think the fact that they are different things obviously they are is an objectioni can understand why you would laugh at this its like how christians in the us laugh at people who think their definition of marriage is outdated at least they havent figured out how to brigade redditors for using the common usage of the wordedit should point out im not trying to make any kind of ethical slur there i refer to the fact that the meaning of the word marriage has changed over time and many religious groups deny that the term can be used to describe nonreligious definitions of marriage just like the word socialism has changed over time and many socialist groups deny that the term can be used to describe a broader range of relations of production dont mean to imply any ethical claims from that,2,85,2,86,30
ok thats definitely surgery in your case was this a dutch dentist or your dentist back homeif it was your dentist back at home take those xrays to a dutch dentist and ask for a referral as these procedures will not be done by dentists in the netherlands but only by dental surgeons you will need a referral to one of groningens hospital this is not optional in the netherlands you cant just walk into a hospital and get treatment unless you are being brought in from an ambulance in life and death situations you need a referral from a primary care provider dentist or gp to get in this also is something good to know in general though if you find yourself in a situation where you might need medical care outside of office hours dont go to the er directly again unless its in an ambulance but call the huisartsenpost which is a centralized gp office which is available during out of office hours if necessary they will give you an immediate referral to the er but if you show up at the er without a referral for a non life or death situation dutch insurance will not cover your expenses its a common procedure you probably wont have to stay in the hospital dagbehandeling day treatment ive looked up the waiting times for the university hospital according to their website the waiting times at the dental surgery department is about 4 weeks for these basic procedures usually the other nonacademic hospitals are a bit shorter but at least this gives you an indication this waiting time if from the moment your dentist provides their referral to the hospital and they register you ive also needed jaw surgery i found the surgeons at the university hospital to be very kind helpful and professional and the hospital itself is very modern and well equipped you should check with your insurance company whether theyd cover the costs i dont have a specific breakdown of the costs but if id have to make a rough measurement it would probably cost in the 10001800 euros range to have them extracted surgically in the hospital this was what my insurance company paid for a day treatment issue i had that required local anesthetics but not ortho related though,93,30,40,12,67

what you may be looking for is to declare the variable group4 as new picturebox that tells vb to declare a new object as a picturebox object this allows that variable to have all the properties of a picturebox object and along with it the image property from which you can set or remove the imageits better programming to declare all of your variable types rather than not declaring them and dealing with variants using the option explicit flag forces you to use better programming habits,45,69,26,0,28

as jung said â œthe generalattitude types as i have pointed out more than once are differentiated by their particular attitude to the object the introverts attitude to the object is an abstracting one at bottom he is always facing the problem of how libido can be withdrawn from the object as though an attempted ascendancy on the part of the object had to be continually frustrated the extravert on the contrary maintains a positive relation to the object to such an extent does he affirm its importance that his subjective attitude is continually being orientated by and related to the object an fond the object can never have sufficient value for him therefore its importance must always be paramountâ â psychological types by carl jung 1921 what that means is that the main difference between an introverted and an extroverted function is the relation between the subject me myself the user internal world subjective opinion and the object everyone else objects and human beings external forces external world objective opinion the introvert is sees the external world as a complete different entity from himherself the user â œitâ s me and thereâ s the worldâ while the extravert is directly living in the world and quoting carl jung â œwho are on good terms with all the world or even when disagreeing with it still hold a relation to it by which they and it are mutually affectedâ an important sentence i have to say is about the spending and release of the energy between the subject and the object in the two different concepts introversion and extroversion the introvert focuses on how the object affects the subject while the extrovert focuses on how the subject affects the object that would also mean that introversion vs extroversion would also mean that introversion is much more subjective than extroversion if you would put ten same extroverted types in a room for example typemention they would probably come to an agreement quickly while if you put in a room 10 typemention they would most likely keep a subjective opinion now that is a very particular case there are a lot of factors that come into play but keep in mind that there is no pure introvert or pure extrovert type every type has 4 introverted functions and 4 extroverted functions the introvert having more confidence and creativity in his introverted functions and the extrovert in his extroverted ones which basically means my last sentence was completely wrong and false unless the typementiontypemention would only use one function which is almost impossible since any reasoning would include the use of at least two functions one judging to process the information and one perceiving to absorb the information now if ten introverted functions were to debate a topic they would most likely all have different opinions when if there were ten extroverted functions debating they would come to agreement fast but the functions arenâ t human beings so that is impossible also one thing i hear a lot by most people is that â œextroverts recharge with socializing and spend their energy with alone time while the introvert recharges with alone time and spends their energy with socializingâ while that might be true in some cases and to some extent i think a better phrase would be that â œextroverts recharge from their outside and spend their energy one the inside while the introvert recharges on their inside and spends their energy on the outsideâ â œoutsideâ doesnâ t always mean â œpeople and socializingâ there can be extroverts that are extremely drained by people and peopleoriented extroverts so in conclusion the â œextroverts are people who go at parties and stay with peopleâ and â œintroverts are people who stay alone and play video gamesâ is relatively true in majority that means that if you are an extrovert it is more likely for you to go to parties more and if you are an introvert it is more likely to stay in the house more but thatâ s not a must also do not confuse introvert with shy it is true that most shy people are introverts but extroverted shy people exist and introverted nonshy people exist do not confuse those terms also introverts more or less feel as if they always need to hold to the connection of the outside world all the time otherwise that connection would be lost they always need to drag themselves to stay in touch with the external world one second you forget about it and the connection is lost extroverts are the other way around they always need to drag themselves to stay in touch with their inner world you blink and connection is lost often where this connection lost thing is happening its called tertiary loops,3,74,4,46,92
most definitely not to mention that typemention sometimes dont even know where they are or how they got there i have many different approaches and levels of fucks given its complicated at work i want to be able to get shit done and not have any problems i attempt to act how i need to in order to accomplish that thats it i worry for my reputation so far as it impacts me practically socially i kind of care but not so much that i want it to be work if i offend people i generally dont give a shit but im usually less offensive than i used to be i do hold more back than i used to because i see no reason to make the world less pleasant for people the only time i really care is when i meet those few rare people i think i might be able to really be myself with i hit them with full intensity laser beam level 100 and if they dont like it it hurts my feefees for about a day then i remember that hey if they dont get itdig it then they belong in the general idgaf social cannon fodder bucket with really close friends i have learned to just be completely open and this has happened in stages i think largely because i have met some few people who really see my guts and actually really dig them i have so much more confidence to just say all the things warts and all because i do have people who see me and love me if i get negative feedback on anything i consider it and it may actually really impact my view of self and that can be a bit painful but like thats just your opinion man at the end of the day i think all cogfuncmention types are somewhat obsessed with the truth and really desire to truly see people and be seen i think we all want to find others we respect who can help us see ourselves and our lives with more truth and clarity it seems to be a common thread that tifefeti weights connection with others very heavily in their worldview and i do think this is at least partly why witness me i mention this because in my life when i found those close people i mentioned i cared way the fuck less what other people thought of me most of the world are just npcs to me now if people dont have the truth of me to a very finite degree then their opinion is simply a variable to be manipulated on whatever quest im on just as when i get the sense that someone doesnt understand why x is the way to accomplish z i take what theyre saying with a grain of salt,15,85,15,85,15

the medical model is inherently biased to consider deviation from the norm a condition if that condition interferes with normal function and causes distress i am not arguing that schizophrenia is a personality type but certainly a lot of conditions and disorders are common enough that they are simply variances which dont fit as well as other variances into the modern world in most contexts ceos are more likely to be psychopaths for example treatment doesnt have to be pharmaceutical it can absolutely be behavioral or even environmental finding an environment which well suits your condition i think its comforting and in many contexts very useful to consider significant deviation from the norm as diseases but in many cases they arent if you read the dsmv every single person on the planet has some kind of a disorder this is a very common critique of the manual at the end of the day it comes down to managing your own life and if you choose medication to help out with that i dont see it as much different than all the billions of people who drink booze to reduce anxiety drink coffee to stay alert smoke pot to relieve menstrual cramps etc the only real difference is in our stigmas towards controlled substances and towards the specific conditions were treating people like to throw around the word crutch is a calendar a crutch for memory deficit sure and you should feel like a failure for using one in my day we remembered our schedules by composing lyrics you nancy i digress haha mbti doesnt really actually explain much its not really clinically useful at all i think we have this idea that there is a healthy brain and an unhealthy brain and mbti is all about the healthy brains in reality healthy is literally defined by effectiveness and affect and effectiveness is dependent on environment an ocd sufferer who manages their condition and leads a normal life is very likely to never be diagnosed that doesnt mean the person doesnt have ocd its just not clinically significant you are less likely to find an ocd sufferer here as you are among js why is that,15,85,15,85,15

it is one thing to give the engine rules to operate by quite another to compose them in such a way as to achieve the goal for example in chess and go rules are simple but their combination very complex ai systems are always reacting to new unseen situations not merely replaying a few scripted responses the ai model is a synthesis of its training data that can generalize its application to new unseen data where conventional programming simply doesnt work or is too fragile you can also think about self driving cars they need to react to any situation on the road which might not fit exactly with any situation it has seen during its training thats what makes ai different ability to go from example to generalization,57,90,21,15,43

firstly as i mentioned they are complementary proteins excluding soy protein isolate forgot you can use that and as your graph shows they require consuming large amounts of food with high carbohydrates and fats see the nutrition of peanut butter and peanuts good luck consuming enough soya and beans to get the same level of complete proteins as a few sausagessecondly the graph is inaccurate per cost for chicken which has a very low cost per gram of protein admittedly the cheapest tends to be chicken leg with skin which is not as lean as most chicken ill find sources on that in a momentyou could eat soy protein with bread and a variety of vegetables and that would be a relatively costtime effective diet im not suggesting you cant live a nutritional vegan diet but it does involve substantial time and effort to do it well balanced and complete nutrition is frankly the easy part its getting the equivalent calories thats difficult,2,85,2,86,30

think about it if you were a writer the first thing youd stumble on is trying to write characters and then youd google how to write good characters and it naturally leads you to personality theory im certain that jk rowling used it i think rr martin uses the enneagram which makes more sense to me as well its all about motivation and thats what it takes to craft a characters plot the only other thing i know writers do is model their characters off of people they know but considering that they probably introduce tens of characters they might not be able to find that many interesting people either but they could always mirror characters of other literature and perhaps rely on tropes they could also use psychology i know frank herbert was deeply interested in the unknown depths of our minds and his books kind of explore that im not sure if his characters have much relation to mbti or enneagram theory i feel as if his characters are more expressions of a collective pattern of human behavior than actual people i would think that a combination of big 5 psychological theory and the enneagram would be the best method of crafting a believable character,34,21,82,74,20
this is a good point id figure there would be a decent faq that gets added at this point in time when a common question is asked which again where vitapiracy is quite helpful in people come in here to get help over maybe a specific error or trouble that could be anything but general in my opinion the sub is here so people can post what they want and unless its a hard rule that youre not allowed to post any sort of questions in the sub i dont see a problem in creating a topic thats uncommon from experience questions in the general questions thread that i asked get a one post answer with no follow upleaving me hanging im not saying this to sound entitled but we all started not knowing anything and the only way to learn is to ask people tend to ask the same question because they cant find the answer or theyre too lazy to no one is responsible for responding to a common question and no one is entitled to get an answer to their question no reason to rage about it imo like op is i also think that there are people who feel like if someone wants to figure out the answer to their question they need to figure it out on their own doing your own research with trial and error which could possibly lead to even more problems but hey their problems are their problems right,79,90,18,95,30

well data is not truth anymore than consensus is i think if truth is intelligible otherwise there would be no such thing at all it conforms to logic not statistics or datadetermining the nature of the material universe is science i just told you the bible is never intended as science and i think you agreed so youre contradicting yourself are you sating science does this what do you think defines our place in the universe and what modes of inquiry would reveal this to us do you think the material universe is the entire universe it isnt you believe in numbers dont youseriously check out this book i mentioned the structure of scientific revolutionsits very arrogant to suppose you are in direct contact with real life or that religious people arent and this view of religion as a comfort or a coping mechanism is one i very commonly see and yet it just shows no understanding of religion it deals with it in a completely tonedeaf way i assume youre from the westchristendom even if you werent raised christian so you probably at least heard the words jesus said on the cross according to the gospels father why have you forsaken me you think thats comforting that illuminates a reality about life and does not run away from it like you are saying it does the christ story for example shows what selfsacrifice means thats not something that science can do science cannot tell us how to live our lives thats something religion does and before that mythology did,38,86,10,3,69

dutch i needed a lot of medical care both emergency care and planned non emergency surgeries i think the biggest thing that important to understand is that in my country not a single person would even stop to think about going to a doctor or ordering an ambulance or whatever its the most normal thing ever to go to your gp if you have issues or questions or are unsure about your health ambulances are released as a standard practise for any road accident or whenever police has to show up to a situation with only the possibility of needing medical care this can be as much as just checking for concussions after a minor car accident nobody worries about costs or avoids doctors because of cost i pay 120 euros a month in insurance but also get 80 euros from the government each month because im a low income student gp visits dont cost anything but specialist care does to a maximum of about 300400 euros a year as thats the maximum by law this systems can only be run because of a meticulous gatekeeping system no one can just randomly walk into a hospital for treatment for non emergency care you need a referral from your gp or dentist and yes waiting lists are involved for emergency care the only way in to the er is either by calling an ambulance for life threatening emergencies or through the gp or the 247 outpost gp who will refer you to the er for example i broke my ankle not realizing how bad it was i didnt call an ambulance but instead called the gp outpost it was the middle of the night and booked an appointment about 1 15 hours later in this case the doctors assistant who run the reception act as gatekeepers and decide whether you may or may not need an ambulance instead you could also just call our 911 and the dispatcher will be the gatekeeper when i got there they gave me a referral to the er and i went straight over once at the er i had to wait maybe 30 minutes to see a doctor but in the meantime the nurse stopped by multiple times to get me some painkillers etc after diagnosis everything is taken care of for you the hospital will plan all your appointments and surgeries first thing in the morning and they will call you informing you about everything when i was admitted there was never any pressure to get me off the ward as soon as possible theyd rather keep me for a few more days if they werent sure about my recovery no questions asked but yeah the day that you do leave they ask you to leave quickly and not linger as theyll fill the bed within hours of you leaving over the past two years i needed 7 surgeries multiple hospitalizations and lots of specialist medication total cost to my insurer about 30k total cost to me including monthly insurance pay maybe 1 to 15k,46,27,31,10,84

i would define it how the universal basic income movement defines iteveryone should have enough money for the essentials to be able to access all opportunities in life and to fully participate in society as they wishessentials being housing water transport etc opportunities is concerned with social mobility such as a person of any background being able to attend university without having to worry much about living costs or taking on too much debt fully partipicating means being able to have the time and resources to go and vote having access to the internet no clear socioeconomic segmentation like southerners vs northerners etci know its somewhat of a broad definition but i think the relative poverty line should be set at a level where everyone can be comfortable without having to make tradeoffs and choices between essentials ie not having to choose between heating or eating or being unable to afford the bus fare to a job interview so you have to walk 2 hours etc this is feasible and affordable in wealthy countries if there are good economic policies in place like in scandinavia its the lack of political will thats the problem not economics,45,92,54,62,9

did you ever hear the tragedy of darth lenin the wise i thought not itâ s not a story the capitalists would tell you itâ s a communist legend darth lenin was a dark lord of the commune so powerful and so wise he could use the state to influence the proletariat to create wealthâ he had such a knowledge of the labor theory of value he could even keep the ones he cared about from being poor the dark side of the state is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural he became so powerfulâ the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep ironic he could save others from exploitation but not himself,17,50,8,0,9

as i understand it mbti isnt a personality test it was just presented like this to psychologicaly unaware public to explained it in commonly undestood words we can call this 16 personalities ofc but it not what the word means tbh personality is unique ofc that what confuses alot of ppl about mbti its all fake there are more then 16 personalities we all unique ppl that use it are dumb and astrologicalbut what thing concentrates is on cognitive functions framework how a persons psyche proceeds the world his default tools that he resorts to to judge and perceive outer and inner world and how it all functions together and its much deeper and fundamental than just describing a personalities of pplthen there are tendencies for each type like a person that armed with an axe much rather go chop some trees and build a house from fallen trees than person armed with a knife prolly mostlikely will cut some cane and build some kind of a tend that doesnt mean that with axe you couldnt go cut a cane you could but you still be cutting it with an axe like typemention can be a mathematician and it happend why not nevertheless there are clear tendencies for each weapon what ppl tend to do with their weapon what fits the most if you like but then there is every persons life experience social environment culture parental genes different nervous systems types psychological traumas your friends parents and so on that all affects your personality and how youll be thats why we all unique but you still be armed with an axe and that guy will be with a knife but who knows what will end up happening and how it all will develop but again there are some tendencies depending of the weapon you holding but they are not concrete they are more like describing your style of cutting aka approach to the world,40,98,1,1,83

its an ill posed problem a human that understands chinese is living breathing dynamic embedded in the world learning to optimize some rewards and forming his own values a room is just that a static description of mapping from symbol to symbol its unfair to compare the two the room has seen nothing tasted nothing experienced nothing and yet it has to translate descriptions of such eventsif the author wanted to make the test fair he would have compared a human to a robot that works and learns like humans such a robot would have visual concepts to map words to would have social experiences that would enable it to relate and understandin fact the big prize right now in ai is just that understanding the world creating descriptions of the world that could be used to reason about it and learn intelligent behavior teams of people are attacking all domains vision speech learning behavior and strategy we have nets that understand the sex age body type posture emotion even lipread from a video of a person when all these are combined a model of the world is formed similar to the way humans represent the world this model would be the workshop of ai it will be where intelligent behavior and reasoning would be developedhere is an abstract of a machine learning paper from two weeks ago its state of the art it describes things that put the chinese room to shame its a deeper vision with practical application and verificationlearning natural language inference with lstm natural language inference nli is a fundamentally important task in natural language processing that has many applications the recently released stanford natural language inference snli corpus has made it possible to develop and evaluate learning centered methods such as deep neural networks for natural language inference nli in this paper we propose a special long short term memory lstm architecture for nli our model builds on top of a recently proposed neural attention model for nli but is based on a significantly different idea instead of deriving sentence embeddings for the premise and the hypothesis to be used for classification our solution uses a match lstm to perform word by word matching of the hypothesis with the premise this lstm is able to place more emphasis on important word level matching results in particular we observe that this lstm remembers important mismatches that are critical for predicting the contradiction or the neutral relationship label on the snli corpus our model achieves an accuracy of 861 outperforming the state of the artthis paper talks about sentence embeddings converting words into vectors representing meaning attention memory and proposes a way to analyze two phrases to detect if the first implies the second or not its implementing the core action of reason inference and doing that on top of embeddings that capture meaning from text so it has a meaning representation of text and operates on it to judge if something is true or not does that look like real understanding or not the system is trained on top of a large corpus of text that acts as a replacement for experience its still not a free agent like humans but it could be all we need to do is to give it an interface to the world a place where it can be contacted and its replies printed and teach it by rewards what kind of dialogue is best,57,90,21,15,43

i was wondering if an idea i recently got would be an actual good one or notso theres a protolangish which was spoken by all of the population in all situations until about a thousand years before current time then it split apart into three sections1 the original language retaining its original pronunciation for the most part generally more faithfully pronounced as time goes on because people will stop associating it with their own speech this is used by religious authority and by the highest classes when speaking to the peasants and is a completely learned language by all2 the lords tongue with some changes to the original language but nothing all that extensive the few sound changes its gone through leave it still very irregular though there is very little dialectal variation this is used by the upper classes when talking to each other and it is taboo for the lower classes to learn and speak in they may only use the peasants tongue or the original language3 the peasants tongue with extensive sound changes quite a bit of leveling of declension patterns and ton of dialectal variation and a shit ton of vulgarity this language is spoken by the peasants amongst each other and they may not speak it to the upper classes they may only use the original language when answering to the upper classes and may not speak the lords tongue at allthis is pretty much a medieval societyis this realistic are there examples of something this extensive irl how could i change societal factors to make it more realistic are there any interesting ideas you have that could add to this,26,78,1,4,21

overwatch is overflowing with clean players that is why i do it not often tbh i dont know on which server you play but i definitely get next to no cheatersvac bans are delayed and dont tell me it is easy to get cheats to be recognised by the systemalso the 40 you have banned on your vacstat list are probably followed up by 40 clean people and 20 more cheaters just give it time i dont know why you are so obsessed with seeing if they get a vac anyways first off all it leads to vac is shit threads where people without knowledge rage around and for the second part feeds your egocan i go into games now and say i have a 90 banned ratio on vacstat so you definitely cheatbut back to topic giving random people on the internet the ability to kick people from games is really dumb seriously think about it it would be better if people learn to report the right people for overwatch vac needs time anyways,50,85,15,50,30

this is actually a really interesting point i frequent rchildfree and one of the main annoyances of the people of there is how they loose their friends when the friends become parents mostly because when people become parents the number one topic to talk about is children which childfree people are usually not really interested in thing is nothing really stops you from seeing your friends once you have children or more specifically if your friends had children how would that fact suddenly change why you will or wont be lonely i mean once you have children the reasons or the ability of your friends to visit you will not change child or not your friend needs to get in a car and make time to meet you,93,30,40,12,67
you know what i think is funny when people dont go to groningen and instead go to cities like amsterdam and such groningen might not be big but its still the only city without night curfews for bars and clubs amsterdam for example does have a curfew this is the only city in the netherlands where you can literally party and drink until 67 in the morning the same goes with social student life in general groningen might be small but it lives up to the big cities in many things that students care about also this being a small city means rather cheap living expensesi do miss the array of specialist shops a big more metropolitan city has or the proximity to major international airports and facilities like major ngos which i might be interested in to volunteer for being based in major cities i most likely will move to a bigger city after getting my degree because most big corporations are also based there etc etc,50,85,15,50,30

deny is too strong of a word in regard to that limited article i could have said â œfail to acknowledgeâ but when we look at chomsky entire work there is a form of denial at play chomsky is so onesided against the west that it undermines his message i would expect such lack of nuances from politicians when talking of their opponent but not from a public intellectual that enjoy a great deal of freedom and could speak without bias this attempt at painting the west with a single brush is detrimental to progress you could for instance put obama in the same bag as bush and cheney because of use of drones and their failure of closing guantanamo saying â œitâ s all of the sameâ failing the see the notable distinction by painting the west as one entity as if it was the same person making all the decisions for the last 40 years is counterproductive to a civil discussion that lead to advancement,39,89,1,22,61

1 i was talking about the actual meaning of these concepts nothing i said hinged upon the psychological feasibility of believing in them2 youre making a logical argument for the psychological viability of believing in something that whole category of argument can only work if you presuppose that people are uniformly logical in the formation of their core beliefs and modus vivendi they arent why would you think they are3 again i mean i hate to say this but the validity of all of what you said really hinges on what you think it means to exist etc like you assume experience necessitates something exists many people in neuroscience like the churchlands and hardcore materialists like them dont think minds or mental experiences really exist as such,38,86,10,3,69

no because your offhand slot is given up by your two handed weaponi find thinking about it as actual hands to be confusing as you can make offhand attacks with more than just your hand instead of that think of like diablo you have two slots that can be occupied by certain weapons if you put a one handed weapon in one slot and only use primary attacks then you get the same bonus as a two handed weapon two handed weapons always take up two slots if you want to use a second weapon in the second slot you get another attack but you give up the twohanded bonuses it is a tradeoff imp and greater two weapon fighting give you extra attacks with that offhand slotit is set up that way for a reason there are quite a few abilities that rely on wielding in two hands that give a bonus to you when doing so for example the 31 power attack bonus and also the 15x strength bonus this can be seen with the curved elven blade as you get those things at the expense of your ability to wield a second weaponbasically what you are asking for is to get the benefits of two handedness without the sacrifices and the benefits of two weapon without the sacrifices as well the benefit for not using an offhand attack is bonuses to damage and a few feats and abilities can be used the tradeoff for using two weapons is that you cant use that to try to do this sounds awful munchkiny if you want to get the offhand attack sacrifice the bonuses to your primary attack id allow it if the greatsword was treated when it came to determining bonuses a 1 handed weapon,98,40,1,1,99
