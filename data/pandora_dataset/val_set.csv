i just like to call it emotional pain like if sadness was like in an analogy to physical feelings being soaking wet depression is like having a horrible headache or horrible stomach pain or a broken bone or somethingi think people would prefer to be soaking wet and just undress themselves and change their clothes than to have a fucking broken leg and lets not forget that if break your leg you only feel that horrible pain for a few minutes while depression is constant for months so i would describe depression as chronic pain that can be cured with painkillers like codeine and vicodin and sadness as feeling cold and wet and just a little uncomfortable,3.0,74.0,4.0,46.0,92.0
id just like to interject for a moment what youâ re referring to as linux is in fact gnulinux or as iâ ve recently taken to calling it gnu plus linux linux is not an operating system unto itself but rather another free component of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full os as defined by posix many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day without realizing it through a peculiar turn of events the version of gnu which is widely used today is often called â œlinuxâ and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the gnu system developed by the gnu project there really is a linux and these people are using it but it is just a part of the system they use linux is the kernel the program in the system that allocates the machineâ s resources to the other programs that you run the kernel is an essential part of an operating system but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system linux is normally used in combination with the gnu operating system the whole system is basically gnu with linux added or gnulinux all the socalled â œlinuxâ distributions are really distributions of gnulinux,6.0,74.0,75.0,59.0,29.0

i respect the actress but she was a horribly written character lorraine toussant made her bearable but the character was so incredibly one dimensional mightve worked for a disney villain but not in a complex show like oitnb where most of the characters have some semblance of depth vee stuck out like a sore thumb in my opinioni agree that she did an amazing jobbut the character was so cringeworthy and there was absolutely no redeeming characteristic to her its like the writers thought that her being fake nice to taystee and suzanne would be enoughi dunno i just have to respectfully disagree vee was my least favorite character there was so much wasted potential with her storyline because the writers just made her evil incarnate instead of giving her an actual real personality instead she was just a manipulative bitch to shake things up and move the plot forward it could have been so much more interestingi cant stress enough that it is due to no fault of the actress she did a great job,70.0,45.0,20.0,24.0,40.0

happy friday everyone so the other day i stumbled across susan r grayzels women and the first world war more specifically on a section called prostitution regulation and the hidden scourge and it got me thinking about certain aspects that the book didnt cover like because of the lack of consistent men available for services even though soldiers did go to brothels would the prostitutes pursue other women to make a profit did this affect how people during this time viewed female sexualityalso i stumbled across an article called male heterosexuality and prostitution during the great war british soldiers encounters with maisons tolã rã es i havent read it yet it got me thinking again about the lack of the opposite sex in the trenches so was it uncommon for a straight or even curious man to have gay sex in the trenches how frequently do we think this could have happenwhat are your views on my thought that school put to much historical focus on ww12era germany how do historians jazz up a subject that people already know a lot about what areas of history do you think schools should focus on does anyone know of some good general historical anthologies on the cold war thanks to anyone that can help me i appreciate it,86.0,45.0,25.0,59.0,67.0

i grew up thinking id live the life script go to uni find someone to marry get a kid work on a career but during my teens i would start thinking about wanting to travel a lot for my work living the expat life and that i really just wanted one kid but this kid should be intelligent and adaptable as well to be able to life the expat life i wanted this went on for a long time adding more and more boundary conditions to the life script then at 18 i met my so who didnt want children and he simply asked me why do you want children at all and i figures i couldnt answer that question now i think i dont want children at all i think if you want children thats fine but if you do you need to put that kid on absolute priority number one and if you want a kid you cant put boundary conditions on what kind of kid it is going to be you need to be just as happy with a highly ambitious and intelligent kid as with a less intelligent kid with possibly bahavioural issues and thats simply not the case for me so i made the decision not to have children i wouldnt put that child before my own some would say selfish priorities and i wouldnt make a good parent to a kid that turns out less ideal then i ideally want the kid to be on top of that overpopulation and man made environmental pollution are real issues and i truly feel that anyone who doesnt absolutely want children shouldnt do so to help our environment recover now im in my 20s and planning an amazing career with my so we will be living all over the world not staying in a single country longer than a few years before moving to a new place i am really happy now that ive settled my mind on this issue it gives a lot of peace of mind,93.0,30.0,40.0,12.0,67.0

yes it was pointed out to me in elementary school that i have leadership skills and so i was put in a special activity group for it my response was zuh in high school i did some volunteering but generally kept to myself we will say i was working on my self esteemby college i got it and was vp then president for a volunteer program at our university i was also the undergrad rep for our entire department so spent a fair amount of time meeting with my professors and learning how a university works i have always done volunteering but i have found i enjoy pr building long lasting genuine relationships especially with sponsors and that my sincere nature allows me to sell the mission of our organization i can pretty easily persuade others and rally excitement to get people working after college i started a non profit from nothing and headed that with our board of directors successfully for five years starting a business from nothing almost taught me about as much as i learned in college where i run into issues with leading is when i get mixed up with people who had selfish or malicious intent i never go in helping with something like a non profit thinking of myself im sure many here can relate i can spot these negative types from a mile away but i try to bring everyone into the fold for a good cause you wouldnt be amazed how people can selfishly skew things that were simply meant to benefit the community i butt heads frequently with people who are two faced or people who generally resent authority and see me as the authoritative figure i try to relate and reach out to all parties to find a middle ground but sometimes doing that rather than putting your foot down will get you in trouble so i am still learning in my early 30s i learned that people who have selfish intent also get mad when you use logic and facts to hit home your strategyphilosophywhatever because they cant skew facts for their own selfish agenda in a small group of friends if no one takes the lead i will do it i cannot stand not having a plan and people waffling around with their thumbs up their asses make a decision and lets go have fun,57.0,80.0,86.0,79.0,55.0

last but not least letâ s take a final and more indepth look at each of the â œrolesâ the functions in your stack takeyour dominant function your 1st function this is the function that you use every second of your life your dominant one the one you get a grasp from the minute you were born its also your strongest and the most valued by you itâ s your main â œway of beingâ i donâ t have much to add here other than it is the true function you can call â œegoâ or â œselfâ looking at this process you can truly say â œthis is meâ the dominant function isgtaccepting accepting functions are used to make some sort of â œviewâ of the world focusing on obtaining a picture of reality and ultimately understanding it gtmentalconscious you are conscious of the use of mental functions and can explain pretty well what you are thinkingdoing with itgtstrong strong functions can have a more sophisticated grasp on information and can be used practically for the benefit of oneself and othersgtinert inert functions are rather rigid inflexible and resistant to changes from environment or self inert functions do not integrate information from the environment thus the strength of these functions remain the way they are these functions are rather rigid in their functioning they are almost immune to internal changes they require an external impulse of sufficient strength so that something in them changes your auxiliary function your 2nd function this is the function that supports the dominant because the dominant simply cant work without this if the dominant is a judging informationprocessing function it needs a perceiving auxiliary to absorb the needed information to process if the dominant function is a perceiving one it needs a judging auxiliary so it can do something with all the information acquired so you can actually make decisions since this function is reached out to help the dominant we feel about it as a way to help ourselves and help others having a fluffy loving reaction when using it it is what we produce but we never take from this is what we â œgiveâ to the world not what we take from it compared to the dominant function this process is much more flexible with the dominant function systems procedures experiences models etc are made automatically with the auxiliary you can choose to make one or to not the auxiliary function isgtproducing producing functions are used as a way to change the realityenvironment thus they do not merely reflect the reality as accepting functions do but generate an altered imagined picture of the world which serves as a solution of their tasksgtmentalconscious you are conscious of the use of mental functions and can explain pretty well what you are thinkingdoing with itgtstrong strong functions can have a more sophisticated grasp on information and can be used practically for the benefit of oneself and othersgtcontact contrary to the rigid functioning of inert functions contact functions are flexible and nonresistant to change they adapt and integrate new experiences from the environment these are capable of being improved over time through ability or simply new understandingsyour tertiary function your 3rd function this function balances the auxiliary so instead of absorbing all the information you need to make important decisions if you have a perceiving auxiliary or reprocessing the other side of the equation if you have a judging auxiliary you can just return you your tertiary function 3rd and relax yeah its mostly a relaxing function its strength is not as important for use as the strength of your inferior because the inferior balances your dominant which is more important than balancing the auxiliary it is generally something were not very good at were average but we dont really care anyway while the auxiliary being something you give to the world but not take from the other side of it would be what you take from but never give back itâ s what you benefit from and what you need so you can work better but you almost never produce it we feel about it like child its use is almost childlike and pure and people often call it a â œreliefâ â œplayâ or â œrelaxingâ function since itâ s what we generally use to take a step back and have funrelaxetc the tertiary function isgt producing producing functions are used as a way to change the realityenvironment thus they do not merely reflect the reality as accepting functions do but generate an altered imagined picture of the world which serves as a solution of their

rigid in their functioning they are almost immune to internal changes they require an external impulse of sufficient strength so that something in them changesyour inferior function your 4th function this is the function that balances your dominant function this positively is used as a function to aspire at to make yourself a better person most people have a lovehate relationship with this function more hate in younger years more love when older and mature they might find people that use it extremely annoying but at the same time they kind of envy them negatively it goes berserk under stress but of course in a negative way generally this is sometimes called â œthe shadowâ of the ego to not be confused with the four shadow functions be it the repressed aspect of your personality that hides all your insecurities traumas and biggest fears even with all the negative aspects of it it is the exact part of your psyche you need to work on to face all your fears and come to psychological wholeness the inferior function isgtaccepting accepting functions are used to make some sort of â œviewâ of the world focusing on obtaining a picture of reality and ultimately

im adopted and i would say absolutely my parents are peopleparents i think there are a few keys to this my mother always pointed out that she and my dad had time to enjoy each other and really get to know each other they were married 7 years before they adopted me so many couples start pumping out units the day after the wedding furthermore the struggles they went through before deciding to adopt gave them time to reflect on what sort of parents they wanted to be their struggles helped them grow closer as a couple genetic testing my mom getting her tubes tied going through the strict adoption process being given shit by my dads sisters for not having biological children etc they knew they really wanted my sister and i they had to fight for us pay tons of money and bare everything personal to everyone in a way maybe they had to earn becoming parents adoptive parents are making a conscious decision to have kids i think that helps from the getgo they have to reflect and hopefully be strong in their convictions in the face of a society that looks at adoption with a raised eyebrow those are just some reasons imo why adoptive parents may tend to be more peopleparent types,57.0,80.0,86.0,79.0,55.0

they both look like two light yellowish greens i do mess up and often times color a red over a green but not the reverse as much also they both have the same issue where the blue sliders look the identical there not only that but the left half of the blue slider looks like almost a solid color for 12 of that bar in face messing with the blue there doesnt do much unless you move it more to the right anything to the left is pretty much the exact same color but i do know that 0 255 0 green is identical to orange or yellow and im not sure if i see green at all and from what you said early are synthesizing all the green as all green colors that have primarily green in them look mostly the same color with just different degrees of darkness bluishgreens yellowishgreens and even yellow and orange look just like different brightness of the same color with the difference of light yellow and orange being white i see red blind easy and faint green i took at the optometry office the ishihara and failed the plate that tells you if you are a deutan or a protan and if you are weak or strong it was one that supposively had two numbers the reason why i mentioned those colors was that i noticed it messing around with colored pencils apricot looks like an orange but so does aquamarinei have issues with some yellows greens and oranges being either whitish or white in fact bright yellow appears medium or pale to me i also have issues telling redviolet from darker yellow violets and blues as grey or greyish or even on some occasions black violet as a whole is mostly grey and same with a lot of azures pure blue is okay if not a hint of grey i mess up dark green sometimes and call it purpledark blue in fact anything at all green is just identical to one or two other colors in different spots entirely cyans appear either grey yellowishgreen or tan depending on the one blueish green is identical to yellowish green im not sure why i have issues with this it didnt start until i took some medication but the yellows looking white thing is super distracting for me as i used to see that okay i am kinda questioning though if i dont see red or green very wellother weird stuff here the original and tritanomaly are exactly identical while the others are a little messed up blue cone monocromancy ironically is also close tritanomoly deuteranopia deuteranomaly and normal are almost identical and id go with tritanomoly being the closestagain here tritanomoly is the closest with deutanopia and deuteromaly being closemessing around on my phone i cant tell the difference between the tritanomoly simulator and the deutanomoly simulator and tritanopia doesnt even look very different could it be that i have issues with both green and red cones if i had both problems with green and red cones wouldnt i have issues with seeing yellow as those are comprised of both what i do know is that the cx 65s didnt work at all for me and the cx 25s are not having a major effect except on yellow stuff that appears whitish without them i was legit surprised when my french fries were golden and not white even then though even after a month the effect is weak and im considering refunding themin general though im not sure if green exists for me at all and appears to be filled with different darknesses of orange there is a certain orangishpink that is colorless to me that i have a hard time finding and also a certain fully saturated greenishcyan that is completely colorless weird to say but these are invisible colors the orangishpink i only knew the existence of when i put on enchromas as well as a offwhite yellow that were colorless without the glasses and color normal people confirmed they were the colors i was seeing them with the glasses on without them they are just completely white to the point of being colorless,98.0,40.0,1.0,1.0,99.0

i dont think an instructor touching your head like that can cause multiple days worth of headaches the initial headache might indicate a purification that was happening on ajna chakra there could be other causes like something that is stressing you a tensed neck muscle irradiating pain or as you say the smokei have had that kind of touch performed on me many times in the past with the express purpose of inducing energy from my instructor to me but never had headaches i have seen many people receiving the same induction without problems kundalini awakening might produce painful experiences but it doesnt fit well with the description kundalini acts on the spine you would have sensed something along that routei would recommend grounding practices to balance your energy and reduce its intensity the full body relaxation is a good one where you scan your whole body with your awareness slowly relaxing muscle by muscle or better go see a doctor ask for something to help you with the pain its not always the fastest route to meditate your pain away,57.0,90.0,21.0,15.0,43.0

i met my so when i was 18 at my first week of uni nonetheless and he was close to 6 years older than me we have now been together for over 4 years and live together as well and we have one of the most healthy relationships i know among my friends and acquaintances but here is the thing i had been through some heavy shit in my teenage years and was on all accounts very much more mature than the average 18 year old yes my so was in a different life stage but we were able to communicate and understand eachother on the same emotional level we were also both at a very emotionally stable point in our lives we were and are in many ways eachothers equal and grew together over the yearsthe thing that worries me about this girl is how she talks about being lonely that in it very self shows shes not emotionally stable enough to handle a tricky non standard relationship because of the age difference she does not seem to act out of infatuation or love for you specifically but simply out of the need for emotional comfort and thats not something you should want for your life,50.0,85.0,15.0,50.0,30.0

overall looking back at your relationship of the past 10 years would you say it is a good happy relationship i have a sort of general rule for myself when it comes to relationship troubles relationships will always have ups and downs but if the down is most dominant for about the last 10 of the total length of your relationship in your case the last year or so you should strongly reconsider your relationship if not for example in the case of down periods that are generally short but may pop up often i think you owe it to yourself and your partner to try and work on your relationshipif thats the case you need to talk to your wife and tell her that you are at the brink of calling it quits but that you want to work on your relationship and that this will mean two things 1 the marriage is from that moment onwards closed again and she needs to stop seeing lee period2 the two of you go to marriage counseling starting as soon as possible,2.0,92.0,31.0,60.0,53.0

ironout appears to be primarily bisulfites which are used to kill bacteria and clean equipment in preparation for fermentation in beer and wine they are also added to the wine itself as a flavor preservative if you are allergic and react to wine cordial beer or anything with bisulfite type preservatives usually labelled in the e221 range in the form of headaches nausea coughing breathing difficulties you may want to try using hydrogen peroxide to clean instead which should do the same jobwhat you see when you add it to water is the citric acid and the sodium carbonate neutralizing to produce co2 which may hiss and bubble but is completely safe its almost literally sherbet just add icing sugar its good for cleaning grime and descaling oxides off of metals in kettles and watertanks i believe you should use it while it is reacting the metabisulfites dissolve readily in water and produce sulfur dioxide which will smell like burnt matches and is an irritant to some people particularly asthma sufferers if you dont want to use iron out you could simply clean it with a bit of vinegar bicarb soda and hydrogen peroxide but i would guess it to be cheaper to buy ironout,34.0,21.0,82.0,74.0,20.0

this depends on what mbti means to youthe mbti test that you take and which has been studied academically in actual scientific papers is to my knowledge regarded as simply an incomplete basis on a subspace of human personality in this picture the space of behavioral human personality is basically a 5d space and the mbti is some 4d subset of that this is the dichotomy based ie ns tf and jp the reason mbti is out of favor is because those letters have correlations with one another perhaps being more n is more likely to make you f or some such thing they mbti dichotomies not mutually independent additionally they lack in describing neuroticism which means your mbti type fails to predict behavior that other personality tests could detectso what happens if you give the mbti along with a bunch of other personality tests and then try to find the groupings of questions that result in 1 mutual independence and 2 a complete coverage of the academically important read predictive factors what youre effectively doing is called dimensionality reduction or principal component analysis and it results in the big 5 personality scale in big 5 the major human personality traits are mutually independent and as predictive as the previous tests including mbti so in this respect the mbti test is obsolete its not a bad test as such but the big 5 basically subsumes it by the way this is why 16personalities adds the assertiveturbulent dichotomy so they can bring their test to at least cover the same space as the big 5 even if not quite as cleanlymbti itself was originally a proxy invented to attempt to discover the relative important of jungs cognitive functions however its taken on a life of its own and the dichotomy based result is what ended up being used academically before it was superseded the simple dichotomy based mbti test itself ends up being the same thing as the big 5 only worse in actual usefulness in this picture your mbti code is the fundamental result any underlying theory does not existthe theory that the test was originally supposed to be a proxy for is in the eyes of jungian typologists more fundamental unlike the purely final resultoriented academic tests it tries to serve as a model for how human personality gets to be the way it is which is an angle thats inherently more interesting to a lot people because it answers many more why and how questions in addition to serving as something of a roadmap for selfimprovement and selfawareness if mbti means this more fundamental model then the test is merely measuring the final results of your underlying functions and extrapolating back to the underlying functions stack but the result on the test does not define your type nor is it fundamental to jungians and the way that it is supposed to connect back to your underlying functions is perhaps questionableput another way neither the speed you see on your speedometer nor the force of the wind on your hand as you put it out the window nor the radar reading from the cop as he pulls you over are your speed they dont define your speed your speed is the magnitude of your position change with respect to time but you can measure it in multiple ways all of which are merely an approximate indication as to what your speed is and all of which must be connected back to your speed by some argument or theoryconclusiontldr so if the mbti is the four letter code returned by the test for you then you treat that result as fundamental and are not in a position to discuss cognitive functions in fact youd be much better served by the big 5 and theres a lot of interesting research connected to itotherwise if the mbti is instead supposed to represent your functions then given that the test is only tenuously linked to what your underlying functions are you can use other ways of probing those functions posting here is one way to do that,30.0,70.0,15.0,15.0,50.0

in other words you still havent honed your skills to separate relevant information from irrelevant information its not that using linux on the desktop is hard you can use as much or as little of it as you like but the deciding factor whether you succeed with it is your ability to not get lost in all the irrelevant possibilitiesthe esxi and proxmox ve example might be portuguese but looking up only one of the terms would have revealed that this is enterprise server stuff and thus irrelevant to desktop usage and safely ignored a three second search on a search engine is all it takesalso you are using gaming as a justification to yourselfus to keep using windows if you truly would want to use linux as your main driver you would forego windows only games even windows doesnt have 100 game coverage so you are forgoing games that dont run on windows so you are ok with running windows and switching to linux is just a nice what if thought propositionbefore you come back with why you cant or wont forego windows gaming itll only be illustrative that linux isnt more important to you than running windows and all the i would switch if pie in the sky is just that pie in the sky,30.0,31.0,21.0,17.0,17.0

stop just believing ppl cos they are convincing and made some points these points could be wrong and just looked right cos they were presented in a certained way to a not very versed in these issues people historicallypolitically or there could be other points that would contradict it or shine some other light on it from a different angle but they didnt mention it cos all they want is to prove their point do your own research and use your own brain by your own research i mean not looking up some biased opinions on youtube but for instance go look up what actually communism is not a myth about it but a real term problem is regular ppl dont have a time to fact check everything read the books look deep and do their own research they are busy with their own life so they ultimately just become a believers in somethingsomeone pretty much just because or cos that person sounded convincing or they liked it so it all comes down to a propaganda and manipulating of people opinions that is so called democracy is all about ps even fact checking is not enough for example imagine a person which is arrogant about the autumn leaves he heard something about them but not really then you show him one yellow autumn leave wow then second omg yellow again then third fourth fifth you discuss yellow color for every leave point out that each of them is yellow then you conclude look all autumn leaves that exist are yellow when in fact its a lie ofc though its based on a true facts leaves that were showed are yellow indeed its not nessesary that this person is a knowingly lying he just convinced and fooled himself in the same way want to believe syndrom and when he for instance starts doubting it in his mind he would get back to his leaves and check yellow yellow so im right such ppl are even more convincing cos they are believing in their own leaves concept and not just lying so their emotions and expressions would be quite authentic though its doesnt change the fact that leaves arent all yellowyou can read tons of various examples of such u0430 false logic and argumentation for instance here which is used all the time in our society and its a norm which is very sad debates discussions tv news youtube just talks between ppl and alex jones is a king of such types argumentions for sure d,40.0,98.0,1.0,1.0,83.0

you should include a secondary class since many types alternate between two or more rolesfor me its mainly defence or support or special attack roles deep flanking maneuvers etc ideally one that can do all threetank or healer or most front line attack roles requires too much coordination with teammates i cant keep up with that its exhausting ill often play those classes in defence andor support roles though and i like having a healing andor emergency ally shielding option in any roleboth of general strategies are designed cover for my shit reflexes and favor either the element of surprise or plain old patiencegenerally ill favor decisive action burst damage debuffs shortlived but powerful buffs either defending a location or using cogfuncmention to choose the right place and time to intervene in the main battleor ill go special ops flank attack often with either a tank or attack class i prefer coordinating with the team rather than just go lone wolf though they either provide a distraction so i can go after poorly guarded objectives or im the distraction to pull opponents away from the main battle at a critical timeor ill go full attrition skirmishing dot buffsdebuffs tank in nontank role healer in nonhealer role any of which takes some patience but allows a wider margin of error and slowly grind my way to success,12.0,84.0,7.0,53.0,54.0

huh why how cogfuncmention regards interpersonal relationshipsintroversion by definition deals with subjective data that is if you took 10 individuals put them in a room and forced them to do a task that required their introverted functions then they would all get different results but if extraverted functions were used then theyll all get a similar result i would cite something from jungs psychological types but ive been searching for 10 minutes and i still dont find it then feeling deals with exchange of energy between entities feelings more specifically anything that can be classified as goodevil now introverted feeling cogfuncmention deals with the subjective part of it relationships are subjective not every person on the planet interacts with everyone else the same way psychological distance is another cogfuncmention thing you dont act the same way with everyone etc cogfuncmention is aware of the ratio of the energy of states like the ratio of my emotional state with yours then i can use it to finetune the wavelength and adjust psychological distance eg politenesswhere cogfuncmention dynamic tests just the energy of the state and can influence it using their own emotions thats why socionics calls it emotion whereas for cogfuncmention relation cogfuncmention is hyper aware of its emotional state because it has so many other states to contrast withwhen you use favour cogfuncmention you repress cogfuncmention so you wont be able to know your internal state because youre not comparing your own with anyone youre dynamically comparing the ones out there which is why its theatrical and is the best communicator give people what they wantsimilarly for cogfuncmention repressing cogfuncmention youre not aware of your mental state and ignore it instead focusing your concentration outwards onto objects and unchanging scenarios and doesnt see how it evolves over time for instance it doesnt see how a possibility evolves into a solution since cogfuncmention is static and discretely enjoys possibilitiesand to not say im flooding you with sovionics sociofag bs here is a transcript of what is considered as mbtithe nuance of their ability to mirror another personâ s emotional experience can feel like absorbing since itâ s so spot on but remember â this isnâ t another personâ s emotion in the typementionâ s heart this is years and years of the typemention mapping emotions within themselves and finding the closest proximity to what the other person is experiencingsource when they describe the empathy of typementions cogfuncmention they describe it objectively they abosrb emotions thats what they feel and uhm thats it im not comparing anything gt feand i quote i once heard a description for â empathyâ as â œyour pain my heartâ for an typemention this couldnâ t be more true typemention absorb other peopleâ s emotional energy whether they want to or not if itâ s powerful and there â friend or foe intimate or stranger â your pain is in their heart,3.0,74.0,4.0,46.0,92.0

from my own experience so totally anecdotal at those younger ages it was my mother a couple of aunts and uncles and a teacher who would push me away from stem while my dad was incredibly supportive of it i clung on to my dad who taught me to stand up for my self and be proud of my interests its not black and white but more like a tug of war and such events could have helped me and my dad by getting me in touch with girls with similar interests so i would have an easier time knowing i was indeed not the weird one of the bunch i by the way agree that we will never reach a 5050 split in most professions and thats ok with me but right now you see that in many cases there is a 1090 split in disciplines such as engineering and nursing this will never be 5050 but i do believe we are missing out on talent even if its just a few male engineers whod rather get into nursing and a few female nurses who want to get into engineering but decided otherwise due to social pressure etc i think thats my bottom line even if the percentages dont change getting rid of the social pressure on men and women is still a valuable thing to society,2.0,92.0,31.0,60.0,53.0

critsrc told me you remind him of me i can confirm lmao youre an enthusiast no sounds to me like youre mostly motivated by what is most pleasurable rather than say what other people require from you what makes you competent security or any other such thing one thing that i have found with typemention is that it is somewhat of a contradictory type kind of confusing to understand it is a thinker type but dominant in intuition and balanced by tertiary cogfuncmention it makes typemention seem very all over the place one moment they are highly analytical pathological assholes the next they are warm fuzzy hippies and everyones best friend in contrast to the xnfp a thinker will find it easier to list reason why they do the things that they do eg what clothes you wear what courses you pick most typemention will literally throw on all sorts of clothing from their wardrobe that they bought on a feeling they know what is truly them this is the same for the typemention maybe a little less spontaneously but their focus is on aligning themselves with their personal values the cogfuncmention types i know are usually against certain morals based on feeling values eg i do not like marijuana because the people who smoke it are assholes and bogans but the people who are mature that smoke are not bad in comparison to the tp types who may struggle with making an argument from such sentiments and might prefer something like smoking pot is fine it is not harmful to your health so who gives a shit the tj types as far as i know also have some of the cogfuncmention it is not unusual to see them argue based on what is good or bad one thing to note is that for the ntps nothing is held sacred cogfuncmention is not their strongest trait which leads to them often getting into trouble for violating other peoples sensibilities eg questioning why we dont eat human flesh the ntp is usually willing to consider such a question in order to get to the truth however dark it is and it has historically gotten them into trouble with the moral guardians of societysounds like you could be overanalyzing that is something i have been lapsing into recently i will have something that must be solved that my brain will sit there indulgently chewing on it endlessly searching for a solution trying to break concepts into their constituent pieces to arrive at an overarching truthi never read them either for the first couple of years i am doing that this time it is far superior what convinced me to do it was elon musk he never even went to lectures he learns everything from textbooks because it is far more efficient and it is usually a superior source also if you have time to spare try opening random chapters for fun and purely out of your own interest that will probably help to get comfortable with the authors style and keep you focusedregarding the cogfuncmention vs cogfuncmention inferior question i have found this fairly difficult to distinguish as well the reason i know that my cogfuncmention is dominant is because it is what i am continually searching for the links and branches between every piece of information i receive eg connecting game of thrones to the war of roses which is followed by the tudors and then a time where my direct descendants of england mined tin through all of these connections i see the metal itself when i look at tin i do not see a soft metal in front of me but everything it is connected to and all of the abstractions it can take it is like a flow of images that take preference over reality cogfuncmention on the other hand is an internalized impression of the metal a collection of what the user has experienced with the metal how it feels how the properties affect them they orientate themselves through this subjective feeling and they seek it out this is why an cogfuncmention type is considered more stable they find comfort in those impressions the cogfuncmention type on the other hand does not once something is experienced it might even be entirely discarded eg the cogfuncmention dom will figure out the best study method discover how well it works project what they will accomplish if they stick to it for a year and then abandon it for a different method that is inferior cogfuncmention for the inferior cogfuncmention type the way they know is the way that is most comfortable and they will stick to it sometimes to a fault when a type has cogfuncmention or cogfuncmention as their 2nd and 3rd functions these problems will not be as clear instead the divide will be between thinking and feeling one of them preferred too strongly,34.0,21.0,82.0,74.0,20.0

you make some great points here i read a post once but cant seem to find it that said exactly what you suggest about these functional stereotypes coming from a tertiary perspective i dont know if id actually call them a stereotype but maybe biased towards a certain perspective this biased perspective is still accurate for the tertiary user more or less but doesnt account for the full experience of a dominant user so the tertiary is considered a twodimensional function in socionics whereas the dominant is fourdimensional now think about trying to convert a 2d image to one that is 3d for example it isnt going to translate right as the source doesnt have the necessary depth to fill out that extra dimension the original image is accurate in its proper context but like no matter how high the resolution of your tv is it can never rival real life the rest of what you describe i think relates to the idea that your lower functions are not about how you think but what you do it is also from socionics but i think it makes sense in either system and would suggest behavioral expressions for both the tertiary and the inferior,70.0,92.0,81.0,7.0,5.0

imo what people are describing so far in this thread is actually cogfuncmention and cogfuncmention not cogfuncmention imma break down a description of cogfuncmention for youcogfuncmention is like a web you learn absorb information and you piece it all together learning new concepts new ideas and new perspectives understanding fundamentally and piecing it together is cogfuncmention we see possibilities behind everything even the most mundane objects when you think typemention cogfuncmention dominant they are always the type to invent this is because they dont see a rock as a rock they see the concept of a rock and all of its uses it has weight due to gravity it is structurally solid and dense it is a solid aggregate of minerals and sand with strong chemical bonds this is how we view the world this is why we are never sure of anythingthis is why many cogfuncmention dominants are theoretical physicists including typemention engaging in cogfuncmention for an typemention is when you look outside of yourself and develop a deeply conceptual understanding of the things around us its like when you use a map to work your way around the city the city becomes the map we are not like cogfuncmention types where a city is what they experience it to be if you look at famous cogfuncmention dominants they are not actually wild and crazy or particularly spontaneous with their activities they are just intellectually smart and their concepts are well developedthis stems from the previous ideas it applies to people to effectively use your cogfuncmention you need to be curious you need to learn what other people are about what makes them what breaks them understand them conceptually and how they interact with their environment and the people around them and then connect them to something elsethe trick to using cogfuncmention is to engage in curiosity and seek what is outside of yourself you dont have to go on crazy unplanned trips to do this but maybe that might be what you need to really understand the world what you should do is seek to learn you can do that in any way you wish,34.0,21.0,82.0,74.0,20.0

theoretically ill get to it this weekend but elements of it are still clicking around in my head so its possible itll take longer right now the plan is for three parts part 1 to get four base types part 2 narrow it down to two part 3 finding the best fit type fuck yeahif you want to go real deep on theory stuff id recommend looking up a guy named victor gulenko heres an introductory article its translated from russian i believe note that ipij and ijipits primarily taskbased typemention working on a single project will continue at a single level of energy switching between tasks they can switch up between energy levelsi agree and i often end up with that starting point but it can get murky for some people which is why i wanted to set up the other three groups its pretty common for me to nail down a persons temperament and then immediately know their type based on the stuff i do in part 2 and part 3your questions and meowsocks suggestions are making me want to go in and rework my examples but for now let me give you two orientation examplesexample 1 she does a lot of what i call enspeak lots of talk about potential and projects and fuckin goal journals one time we were in a workshop together and i spent the whole time developing one idea while she make a giant mess of coolness esxx is pretty easy to rule out while she is a very active person she definitely lacks a certain assertiveness shes quite clumsy is fairly oblivious to her surroundings etc etc etc inxx and isxx are pretty easy to rule out because shes one of the most extroverted people i know you can catch a smidge of isxx in a handful of specific things like shes a good cook for example i can fairly call her an enxx and move on to steps two and three turns out shes typementionexample 2 none of the orientations really pop for her like sure she picks up on stuff that other people dont and she talks a lot about the future but how enish is that shes a big time performer and was the total alpha female of the group but it was a bunch of kids from an arts school so how esish do you need to be shes got a solid eye for aesthetics and has very specific interests but she comes off as pretty extroverted so isxx doesnt really fit shes probably not inxx so that can be ruled out i eventually get to typing her in clubs and shes an nf i move on to steps two and three turns out shes typementionnot equal self typing is so damn hard but id say it makes for a better start than just going for the functions this is right the core goal here is to have a solid way of getting someone down to four possible types and to give you a framework for the rest of the typing once i get to step 3 it will help people who are in between two types at least relative to other selftyping methodsthis has been a nice discussion thanks for your questions,34.0,10.0,54.0,33.0,46.0

one thing that i noticed as the season progressed is that the hosts are human as fuck like we could read the same self help books the maze is very similar to the concept of letting go of the egoimage of the self in order to attain enlightenment in that sense the mib desperately needs the maze to move on in his life even the traveling back to the cornerstone and letting it go in order to transcend it is very human the hosts are just a little more simpleliteraltangible psychologically compared to humans but they are very similar to the point that the only real difference seems to be the supposed autonomy that humans possess but of course it is highly debatable whether or not humans are actually autonomous in any true sense a lot of our decisions are silently made for us as wellso is this show an exploration of humanity or of ai is there really a difference between human nature and the nature of any real ai humans manage to create,50.0,85.0,15.0,50.0,85.0

id say the first cut is jarring because it breaks the 180â plane rule instead of staying on one side of a scene even if its not a static shot you cut to the exact opposite side of a scene to line up the next shotinstead it would have worked to either use the same angle in both shots or use a dynamic angle shot to sweep around the character so the camera enters the hole first the character would follow thereby lining the camera up to be in the intended location of the second shot this removes the sudden jarring cut as youd follow the 180â plane rule or allow the audience to see the entire setting to orient themselves,45.0,69.0,26.0,0.0,28.0

i do like the sight of that guandao and i do have to admit that this isnt really my field of expertise first off i wasnt thinking of a rapier isayama hasnt really taken any weapons out of the real world except the rifles of the mps so my guess laid by a variant of the odm gear sword i know that that also isnt practical for cutting open the nape but isnt the nape the last thing you want to aim at during a shifter v shifter fight that would kill the shifter meaning you cant acquire its power for yourselfaside of that is it really that smart to bring a weapon on a wooden pole to a titan v titan fight if the opponents sheer strength isnt enough to break the pole on impact then i see their steam burning the pole after which they can pick up the head and use that as a weapon themselveswouldnt the most effective thing in a shifter v shifter fight be something medium sized that you can use to cut off your opponents limbs effectively disabling them after that happened some simple sc soldiers could simply capture the shifteri do see why those long weapons would be more effective as siege weapons though btw this is reddit you dont need to apologize for textwalls thats the whole purpose of this mediumedit just saw your edit seems like youre imagining a situation where both parties are armed and yes then those swords would be the worst i may not know much about melee weaponry but i do know that much i however was thinking of a situating in which only one of the two fighting sides has weapons,2.0,92.0,31.0,60.0,53.0

im proud of how this thread shook out i like to see other people on this sub come out against hittingspanking to effectively correct a childs behavior especially little ones you cannot simply tell them to stop the behavior or smack them out of the blue you have to redirect away from the undesired behavior and teach the desired replacement behavior typically when an adult resorts to hitting a child it is because the adult has run out of ideas is burned out or frustrated the hitting is a temporary relief for the adult but it does not benefit the childs learning or well being not being funny with this suggestion but the show supernanny clearly demonstrates these concepts very well if you are interested in learning more about it as far as me i have a degree in this area and 8 years teaching experience with kids with severe behavioral issues out of curiosity since you are arguing in favor of spanking so much what are your qualifications,57.0,80.0,86.0,79.0,55.0

sounds like you got a lot on your plate and feeling anxious because of the things you cant control in your life start by making small goal daily tasks that you know you can do this is to help you feel more fulfilled in completing goals and feeling productive worrying and overthinking is an improper use of your imagination grounding yourself by working on things that you can control in your life will definitely help you feel a lot betteryou cant control you you can form a romantic relationship with but you can control the bonds formed through friendship look to companionship through friends and build yourself up from thereyou also cant control how people perceive you or what they do to you you can control how you react to them that girl whos selling you stuff you dont need to be mad smile politely and turn down the item they are selling you can argue with people if they do something to make you feel personally attacked but that doesnt really achieve anything sure you want your feelings and thoughts to be validated when you argue with said person however i dont think there has been a case where when yelling can change the thoughts and attitude of others if anything it makes their thoughts solidifiedmytypementionm friend was at the pit of darkness 5 years ago severely dumped by someone he loved got into a ldr and then got dumped again he was feeling down for the count and pretty much disappeared from all social contacts although i did my best to pull him out of it through bonds of friendship he put it on himself to work on himself and is in a much better place he worked out he applied to grad school he hung out with a lot of his nerdy friends more he even took my advice and went on some dates from online apps though a ton of them were failed attempts he was able to utilize the experience to form a more realistic view on relationships now hes working his dream career he has a great girlfriend and he has a set amount of bffls he can depend on hes become extremely independent and what notthings might not look great now but take it one day at a time and develop your own set of morals things to live by and goals it will help tons in the future,79.0,90.0,18.0,95.0,30.0

a large portion of the potential mistypings is due to the type of questions that you quoted here actually if you dont mind a little rambling of my own ill tell a story about the last test i took and scored typemention this was a written test in lenore thomsons otherwise fantastic book but i scored typemention with supposed 80 accuracy now since i had the scoring system in hand i could go back and see which answers i got wrong all of the e questions i answered based on cogfuncmention and a few cogfuncmention and all of the s questions i answered were based on cogfuncmention a significant portion of the s questions dealt with what you like to do on vacation well all i really can do is go to my home town and see friends and family i dont have time to go on a vacation for myself so boom im a sensor and an extrovert that was a case of a test being bad now that night i told my girlfriend the story she is mildly interested in mbti and is an typemention she decided to retake the test she took the keys2cognition test that i recommended she blew threw it in two minutes and got typemention she did it again this time actually taking her time i watched and said nothing again typemention the third time she explained why she chose each answer and i told her what function it was asking about cogfuncmention responses were immediate as were rejecting cogfuncmention cogfuncmention and cogfuncmention were about to be expected as a little less than moderate each time cogfuncmention popped up she went straight to the not me option and often chose cogfuncmention quickly when i pointed out all the cogfuncmention questions she asked why are those questions so weird i didnt really notice that but yes the cogfuncmention questions mostly asked really strange abstract mystical questions whereas cogfuncmention made you sound like a normal person that has their shit together ill post the questions hereexperience a premonition or foresee the distant future cogfuncmention ornotice whether the details in front of you match what you are accustomed to cogfuncmentionachieve a metamorphosis definitive insight or powerful vision of change cogfuncmention orcompare an experience against a storehouse of familiar experiences to find whats reliable cogfuncmentiongain a profound realization from a mystical state or sudden release of emotions cogfuncmention orfollow steps to ensure tasks are predictable and completed correctly cogfuncmentionfeel attracted to the symbolic archetypal or mysterious cogfuncmention orreview a lot of information over time to confirm what is customary or standard cogfuncmentiontransform yourself by focusing inward on a specific way you foresee you will need to be cogfuncmention orfulfill the same regular work or activity everyday at a comfortable pace cogfuncmentionpush your mental limits to complete an array of innovative achievements cogfuncmention orpoint out discrepancies between how things are and the way they have always been cogfuncmentionnow these questions are indicative of each function and obviously so if you know your functions but they are so divorced from reality when it comes to how an dominant cogfuncmention user would describe themselves it sounds much more like inferior cogfuncmention in the grips of a serious psychotic break this is one of the more respected tests from an a reasonably well respected typemention dr nardi and dr berens not sure of her type i test just fine on this test but not tests are going to accurately type you for due to the eccentricities of the two examples that ive givenconcerning other replies in this thread there are some i strongly disagree with and some that have a lot of merit i dont claim to be an expert at typing strangers on the internet so i could be wrong by agreeing with you that you are an typemention but it makes sense to me trust no one online that claims to be an cogfuncmention dom or any other type for that matter unless they clearly show that they represent their type and typemention more than any other type compare yourself to reputable sources and not people on forums that claim to be such and such a type if you have doubt about your type you can make a post laying out why you feel like you value each function and why you do not value others,70.0,92.0,81.0,7.0,5.0

it varied because 1 my students were cognitively very low and 2 i kept getting new students all the time and had to keep adjusting the schedule i agree with you about doing sciencesocial studies as a group and reading and math being more individual i did that for some time and it worked well i would start from that angle with their ieps and any school mandated programstesting etc prioritize required things first again the schedule will fill itself in hopefully also this year when you write your ieps keep those schedules in mind when writing them make it easier on yourself not harder for example if johnny had a communication goal and a social skills goal we could potentially merge those together during 1 activity we had him use his ipad to play a game with the rest of the social skilla group this way it is also easy to document and report his participation because it is a daily activity,57.0,80.0,86.0,79.0,55.0

i think that some of what is mentioned in the article is overblown to a degree and not all parts as equally present but at the same time the influence is there for instance i recognize the equal draw of either someone who is entirely like me and willcan do that somewhat unhealthy emotional fusion or the other side which is the guy i cant control or manipulate i admit that i do lose interest and respect if someone is too easily into me and bows to my whims without pushing backalso that repetitive nature of being completely into them and then shutting off i know its definitely within my personality to just get bored with someone if they stop presenting either a mystery or challenge to me i can see myself doing the part at the very end where it comes down to making a sacrifice of admitting i just have to buckle down and be a good partner even if im not entirely fulfilled by the relationship it makes me wonder if im suited for relationships in general,83.0,80.0,46.0,37.0,14.0

huh why how cogfuncmention regards interpersonal relationshipsintroversion by definition deals with subjective data that is if you took 10 individuals put them in a room and forced them to do a task that required their introverted functions then they would all get different results but if extraverted functions were used then theyll all get a similar result i would cite something from jungs psychological types but ive been searching for 10 minutes and i still dont find it then feeling deals with exchange of energy between entities feelings more specifically anything that can be classified as goodevil now introverted feeling cogfuncmention deals with the subjective part of it relationships are subjective not every person on the planet interacts with everyone else the same way psychological distance is another cogfuncmention thing you dont act the same way with everyone etc cogfuncmention is aware of the ratio of the energy of states like the ratio of my emotional state with yours then i can use it to finetune the wavelength and adjust psychological distance eg politenesswhere cogfuncmention dynamic tests just the energy of the state and can influence it using their own emotions thats why socionics calls it emotion whereas for cogfuncmention relation cogfuncmention is hyper aware of its emotional state because it has so many other states to contrast withwhen you use favour cogfuncmention you repress cogfuncmention so you wont be able to know your internal state because youre not comparing your own with anyone youre dynamically comparing the ones out there which is why its theatrical and is the best communicator give people what they wantsimilarly for cogfuncmention repressing cogfuncmention youre not aware of your mental state and ignore it instead focusing your concentration outwards onto objects and unchanging scenarios and doesnt see how it evolves over time for instance it doesnt see how a possibility evolves into a solution since cogfuncmention is static and discretely enjoys possibilitiesand to not say im flooding you with sovionics sociofag bs here is a transcript of what is considered as mbtithe nuance of their ability to mirror another personâ s emotional experience can feel like absorbing since itâ s so spot on but remember â this isnâ t another personâ s emotion in the typementionâ s heart this is years and years of the typemention mapping emotions within themselves and finding the closest proximity to what the other person is experiencingsource when they describe the empathy of typementions cogfuncmention they describe it objectively they abosrb emotions thats what they feel and uhm thats it im not comparing anything gt feand i quote i once heard a description for â empathyâ as â œyour pain my heartâ for an typemention this couldnâ t be more true typemention absorb other peopleâ s emotional energy whether they want to or not if itâ s powerful and there â friend or foe intimate or stranger â your pain is in their heart,3.0,74.0,4.0,46.0,92.0

islam has an obvious religious component that is muhammad claimed to be a prophet receiving the words of god its a belief systemmuhammad was also a political leader he gathered a following which eventually did conquest and ruled over a part of saudi arabia establishing a kingdom with laws sharia the kingdom was meant to be expanded until it would rule the entire world the shia of today claim an unbroken link with the heir they consider to be the proper heir of muhammad his soninlawfor various reasons im not versed in the sunni struggled establishing an enduring line of succession this is why a group like isis try to claim to have succedded in recreating the caliphate word for islamic empire using thelogical arguments this is why sunni from all over the world have flocked to isis territory believing the caliphate is up and runningjainism has none of this conquertheworld civilization iii stuff there have been kings who happened to be jains and could contribute to spreading the religion but there is no jurisprudence to draw from and build a jain empire the islamic jurisprudence in the hadith cover every aspect on how to run a state its quite detailled,39.0,89.0,1.0,22.0,61.0

kind of true the bumps are extremely minor there hasnt been a really substantial bump since the mongol empire killed off about 25 of the population i guess the black death counts as well as the total volume of various factors grows ever faster excluding population volatility hasnt increased it can appear that way because the bumps are larger but as a fraction of the whole theyre much smaller take gdp as one example or population growth the wrench analogy isnt really true at all dynamic interdependent systems are far more resilient as a whole than local systems the wrenches thrown in are comparatively smaller and each component can support another if it weakens or fails when part does fail it gets isolated from the rest of the system again you can clearly see how an integrated system works effectively under stress with our recent economic crises you say that people dont realise how weak our social structures are everybody knows theyre weak thats the whole reason we do so well we continuously change our social political and cultural structure to react most appropriately to new situations or to improve upon situations that are already pretty darn goodyou are suggesting that there will be these global collapses when theres clearly no data to support this case i mean what could threaten us on an existential level beyond drugresistant bacteria pandemics dont pose an existential threat but still theyre pretty bad or sentient robots,2.0,85.0,2.0,86.0,30.0

like you said theyre not considered controlled drugs by the uk so youll be fine however in many countries psychoactive drugs are controlled and would require documentation i used to have daily heavy opiate based pain medication if i had to travel with them id need a doctors note stamped and dated with a couple of official looking stamps and signatures it never was much of an issue except that for my opiates i would need very specific documents with very specific stamps because those are controlled substances if all your bottles have the original stickers with your name on them you should be fine when going through customs if a customs agents open up your bag theyll take a look at it ask you a couple of questions compare the name on the stickers to the name in your passport and youd be on your way if i were you however id simply get a doctors note to take with you because you might encounter an incompetent customs control agent and it might help you get out of that situation quick and without too many questions especially considering most of your drugs are anxiety related maybe you can find a general form for the uk controlled drugs and forward that to your doctor so hisher note contains the same info as your drugs arent controlled you wouldnt need to worry about getting the exactly right documentation and stamps like i had to but id get that note just in case,50.0,85.0,50.0,85.0,50.0

its often assumed but i have my doubts about thisi have the impression that crystal is stronger than armor plating seeing how annies few millimeters of crystal was just as effective at stopping blades as reigners few decimeters of armorshe also just needed a few millimeters of crystal around her fingers to climb the wall whilst reigner needed to make entire hardened clawsnow annie isnt surrounded by just a few millimeters of crystal but a few decimeters this means that her protection could possibly be hundreds of times stronger than normal titan armorthere is a solid argument to be made that erens hardened fists might be strong enough seeing how its not only stated that all the combined strength of a set of armor is located in his fists but its also shown how easy he could break through reigners armorhowever i personally prefer the idea that theyd use thunderspears instead of his hardened fists if you try punching a pebble its near impossible to differentiate the amount of force you want to excel at different parts of said pebble erens fists might break annies neck or rip her head off if he isnt carefulthe thunderspears however are simply projectiles with an explosive in their tip its extremely probable that the sc can change the amount of charge they load the weapon with allowing for more precision and less riskit seems like the better option to me,46.0,27.0,31.0,10.0,84.0

just prefacing by saying that i dont mean to talk down to you at all im 23 a year out of college and still feel like a kid most of the time and i am a kid to the majority of society but youre only 15 i never could have grasped this when i was 15 but theres soooooo much yet to happen to you and your peers youll all grow up youll learn more and eventually a lot of them will care in the way that you do i hate to say thats just how it is but really it kind of is ill echo others in saying that you should remember not to feel superior maybe your peers would care but they just havent been educated you never knowand it can be extremely frustrating to be in the position you are i know i feel really strongly about a lot of social justice topics for example but i have friends who dont care and also friends who care so much that they tend to be hostile toward the others about it im stuck in the middle trying to be a mediator and its terrible sometimes what ive resolved to do is to just keep being myself and focus on whats within reach you probably wont save the amazon yourself it sucks but thats the truth but what you can do is let some of your friends know about it or maybe just people who you know that might be receptive even if you changed one or two peoples views you just made it possible for them to spread those views and that potential is enormous typemention tend to lead by inspiration and example and thats a great way to start,70.0,96.0,15.0,37.0,80.0

i was recently reading about aphantasia in the typemention sub and i personally know an typemention who has that same condition for those who dont know its what they call the inability to produce mental imagery theres no minds eye where you can call up visualizations of things memories or otherwise i remember being shocked when i first heard about it realizing that not everyone has a similar internal landscape to my own after reading this article i realized how heavily i also rely on internal dialog often conducted in the voices and manners of other imagined people to think through ideas those conversations are just as vivid and feel just as real as my normal external dialogues like how i was previously unaware that people processed information and memories without internal imagery the idea that internal conversations arent also universal was somewhat surprising i was curious how many of you also get caught up in internal dialogues or work through ideas by imagining conversations with other people edit like the article says its sometimes useful and theres also a limit where it becomes an issue because of my strong tendency to get lost in my own thoughts these inner dialogues can sometimes contribute to my occasional problems with maladaptive daydreaming unlike some of the people in the article im at least aware the people im talking to are fictional characterizations made up by my own mind d,83.0,80.0,46.0,37.0,14.0

another thing your brother is abusing you physically but also mentallyspiritually he not only aggros you but then the parents come in and blame it on you the parents might even be doing this thing called projection on you because when there is a fight there is a starter and this person is to blame so since they cannot experience those emotions on the son who is obviously autistic or if i would rudely put it retarded who can blame the retarded kid its tossed on you so the situation is poorly handled by everyoneseriously before it gets worse i have been through shit like this for basically my whole life ok please please find someone find some way to have this come into clear situations like this where there is really nuffed up stuff happening always always want to be buried 6 feet into the ground like a disgusting frankenstein monster that somebody needs to hide away from everything truth is hard as it sounds these frankenstein monsters need to be in the light so people can understand that they happen so please please seriously find some kind of help about it and not just this situation ok all of them perhaps a therapist somebody to trust who loves you regardless and would want you to be happy but more important than happy just to be okay and accepting of what you know is true basically if you think you cant trust your parents you probably cant obviously you cant trust your brother if you talk to the principal and you have this feeling you can see it in his eyes you can see it in his body language you can see it in his words etc that he doesnt have a clue what youre saying drop it dont bother when it comes to this only those who know know and you will know that they know when they speak to you good luck friend,88.0,88.0,32.0,31.0,6.0

hey answering my page i have never heard of your diagnosis i appreciate you sharing that with us your post made me ponder a few different thingsvolunteering if you have the time tons of programs need your help and do a lot of great work i used to coach special olympics swimming and absolutely loved it this was how i discovered i might make a good special ed teacher then becoming a teacher solidified my cf stance i always say i love spending time with my students but i love sending them home just as much you may find kids fun in large or small doses or not at all your personal preferences i would consider things like what level of cleanliness and order you value do you value your sleep and personal time kids are constant 247 no going back and no time off how do you feel about noise child development in regards to how a kid grows up theres tons of different ways to parent i personally feel that consistency routine and teaching them independence and empathy are some of the most important components bear with me im stuffing a subject i could talk about for days into a single paragraph if you feel you might be distant have a short temper or other adverse reactions that is definitely something to consider communication with your partner needs to be in top form and mostly positive for healthy development of the kids another personal example i dont want kids because i am a worry wart by nature i would simply worry myself into an unrecognizable crazy helicopter mom it takes a lot of reflection knowing yourself and your needs to come off the fence and thats okay give yourself some time the best part about taking time to think about it carefully is that you are doing what is best for the kids so if you have them what a great start in regards to your girlfriend just be very careful with birth control you have plenty of time to decide i like to think of it asunless you are actively trying not to get her pregnant you could very well end up getting her pregnant so for me each day i had an active sex life each time i had sex i was very careful and deliberate with choosing to be safe take it a day at a time for now best of luck,57.0,80.0,86.0,79.0,55.0

okay so youre not an typemention at least assuming youre answering my questions with honestyokay so the first dichotomy i presented you with here comes straight from the in socionics it is meant to characterize how alphas and betas use their cogfuncmention and of the two you selected the alpha sfjntp optionthe second dichotomy also comes from theory characterizing the alpha and betas use of sensing and thinking you once again chose the alpha option the typementions name in socionics is even sometimes the hedonistthe option you chose was my summary of gulenkos pessimism energy which isnt as bad as it sounds it is a russian translation your answer lined up with what id expect to see from an typementionokay so youre an alpha and youre not an typemention youre probably not an typemention either given your choice of hedonism coming so far in first you also seem to really love graphic design and art which is most commonly an sf trait you also use cogfuncmention and cogfuncmention like an typemention does and you related to some key elements of typemention so typemention can come off the table pretty easillyso youre either an typemention or an typemention is that something we can be on the same page for before we start breaking down towards your final typing,34.0,10.0,54.0,33.0,46.0

my understanding is in poorer countries usually there are only very basic industries farming for examplewhen we give them free food we overwhelm their supply and ruin those markets when the free stuff wears out they dont have any economy to fall back on and so go back to being poor were basically flooding their budding economies so they cant growthe us on the other hand has a very well grown economy our markets benefit from cheaper lesser goods because we have markets above them that utilize them eg cheap chips from abroad are used to build computers or something like that theyll flood and destroy those lower markets like on the underdeveloped countries but the us has those higher markets to rely onto overly simplify the entire economy of a poor country is farming so flooding it with food kills the economy higher developed countrys economy is high end electronics so cheep components make that market more profitable and affordable to everyone,17.0,50.0,8.0,0.0,9.0

okay this has been educational i was not aware of the mathematical structure behind the renin dichotomies i stand by my assertion that if you were to test someone on those 15 that they would be very unlikely to come out as one of the types while i was not aware of the structure behind it my own reading of the descriptions of the dichotomies seemed to suggest that they were independent traits i perhaps fail to see why an st or nf would be aristocratic while an nt or sf is democraticill grant you that im probably wrong about or misunderstanding the renin dichotomies its perhaps moot anyway since youre telling me this isnt a core part of the community but this actually illustrates my initial problem with socionics altogether look at the algebra that has been constructed around something as vague and nebulously defined as human personality do they really think that they could impose such a mathematical order on something whose actual internals are not understood at alllet me remind you that we have no concept of the fundamental units of personality cogfuncmention cogfuncmention cogfuncmention etc are abstract categories and labels for sets of habits by which people think and perceive the world there is no reason to expect that they interact in any particular way i stand by my assertion that socionics overspecifies the dynamics of personality to the point of being completely exclusionary of human varietythe periodic table works because its structure is directly related to the structure of the highest energy orbitals of each elements atoms thats what allows it to be very predictive it may have started out empirically but eventually the reason for its structure was discovered by contrast im sure that you will not find discrete analogues to the cognitive functions as we dig deeper into human psychology they are not elementary or even composites of elementary parts and so any prescription of what roles they play is bound to fail the periodic table gets things right to a first order approximation socionics probably not even thatsocionicists sp seem to be afraid of the ambiguity inherent in discussing and categorizing personality into a small number of boxes they want things to be concrete calculable and welldefined when theyre not even working with properly fundamental pieces where socionics deviates from mbti is its desire to make things incredibly constrained and overdetermined is socionics fun to play with absolutely i love getting my hands dirty with theory as much as the next guy here thats why i play around with certain inapplicable abstract math systems as well but i dont pretend for a second that it describes reality its a fun rpg character creation system to me at least mbti recognizes to a large extent what its descriptive limitations are,30.0,70.0,15.0,15.0,50.0

ok so let me start by prefacing this upcoming wall of text by stating that i ascribe to the nietzschean definition of morality and thereby consider myself an immoralist the condensed version is that morality is a consequence of organized religion that has outlived its usefulness by several centuries it cannot be separated from religious dogma yet still limps on like a zombie long after the death of god i see morality as an entirely negative coping mechanism for those unable to think or feel for themselves only useful for those that belong to the herd mentality since if they were to disregard this virtue of theirs they would cast of their only sense of right and wrong i know very well that this is not the colloquial definition of morality but look it up the actual definition of morality spans several pages of contradictory definitions rendering them all just a perspective this means that you get to choose what this all powerful word means because in all actuality it is entirely meaningless now lets look at what makes the typemention unique here as opposed to other feeling inferiors as there is definitely a link here first off look at the structure of the inferior it is what the ego strives for it is idealized yet never achieved or attained it is the focal point of your consciousness morality is usually confounded with cogfuncmention principles whereas ethics are often confounded with cogfuncmention this is about as accurate as saying that cogfuncmention equals memory and cogfuncmention equals prophetic wizardry inferior cogfuncmention is about belonging bonding harmony of sorts it is a live and live attitude it is detached and objective the so called laws of morality are objective not subjective this is not the realm for cogfuncmention believe it or not there is absolutely nothing moral about cogfuncmention if an cogfuncmention user is moral it is only because of their cogfuncmention this may sound crazy but think about it there is also nothing moral about cogfuncmention it is all a function of cogfuncmention i see morality much like the political establishment it is an oppressive force that holds one back and limits expression of free ideas an typemention operates outside of the societal norms and rejects the establishment whenever possible a religious institution is just as illogical as a wall street institution letting moral dogma run rampant is just as ridiculous as giving the banks carte blanche a golden parachute sounds a lot like a stairway to heaven to me but what does this mean it means that those that appear to be moral or proclaim ever so loudly to be morality incarnate are anything but they are so entrenched in the establishment that they dont even know where they end and the special interests begin they spend so much time living what they are told is moral that they never question what actually is moral this is a lack of self awareness and critical thinking skills these are two things that a well rounded typemention does not lack the typemention is only supremely moral because they are separate from morality entirely they see it as a thing not as a way of life,70.0,92.0,81.0,7.0,5.0

another type of wisdom tooth fuck upmy dental wounds felt healed over it had been weeks since my wisdom tooth removal i was back to most normal foods except sharp items like chips and popcorn i love popcorn so i had some and chewed very carefully what i didnt know is a small piece of kernel husk nestled itself back where one of my wisdom teeth had been my mouth continued to heal unbeknownst to me my gums healed right over that little husk flake some weeksdays later my face started to hurt i felt off i went to bed woke up the next day still felt bad but not bad enough to skip shopping with my best friend the next day within an hour my cheek looked like i was holding a golf ball in the side of my mouth i was fading fast feeling woozy my best friend called my mom who arranged the emergency weekend dental surgeon and drove me directly there they were pretty sure what was wrong after my mom described itnsfl the emergency dentist had to numb me up reopen my wisdom tooth site and with a tiny vacuum clean out everything inside this included all lovely infection gunk and the culprit husk i was delirious grossed out and traumatized the sounds smell and feel of this procedure contributed to my many years struggle with sheer panic each time i went to the dentist he was so nice but it was awful i didnt eat popcorn for like a year afterward,57.0,80.0,86.0,79.0,55.0

there are ways to think of reincanation which dont violate physic the first step is to drop duality if we think reincarnation as a soul separate from matter as its often thought then its problematic but if we give up the idea that we are separate entities its open up new way of thinking if the world is essentially some sort of interconnected timeless fractal and thats pretty much where physic is going then the idea that we an experience we are having now is connected to someone else experience in the past or at distance become more intelligible,39.0,89.0,1.0,22.0,61.0

its often assumed but i have my doubts about thisi have the impression that crystal is stronger than armor plating seeing how annies few millimeters of crystal was just as effective at stopping blades as reigners few decimeters of armorshe also just needed a few millimeters of crystal around her fingers to climb the wall whilst reigner needed to make entire hardened clawsnow annie isnt surrounded by just a few millimeters of crystal but a few decimeters this means that her protection could possibly be hundreds of times stronger than normal titan armorthere is a solid argument to be made that erens hardened fists might be strong enough seeing how its not only stated that all the combined strength of a set of armor is located in his fists but its also shown how easy he could break through reigners armorhowever i personally prefer the idea that theyd use thunderspears instead of his hardened fists if you try punching a pebble its near impossible to differentiate the amount of force you want to excel at different parts of said pebble erens fists might break annies neck or rip her head off if he isnt carefulthe thunderspears however are simply projectiles with an explosive in their tip its extremely probable that the sc can change the amount of charge they load the weapon with allowing for more precision and less riskit seems like the better option to me,50.0,85.0,15.0,50.0,30.0

huh why how cogfuncmention regards interpersonal relationshipsintroversion by definition deals with subjective data that is if you took 10 individuals put them in a room and forced them to do a task that required their introverted functions then they would all get different results but if extraverted functions were used then theyll all get a similar result i would cite something from jungs psychological types but ive been searching for 10 minutes and i still dont find it then feeling deals with exchange of energy between entities feelings more specifically anything that can be classified as goodevil now introverted feeling cogfuncmention deals with the subjective part of it relationships are subjective not every person on the planet interacts with everyone else the same way psychological distance is another cogfuncmention thing you dont act the same way with everyone etc cogfuncmention is aware of the ratio of the energy of states like the ratio of my emotional state with yours then i can use it to finetune the wavelength and adjust psychological distance eg politenesswhere cogfuncmention dynamic tests just the energy of the state and can influence it using their own emotions thats why socionics calls it emotion whereas for cogfuncmention relation cogfuncmention is hyper aware of its emotional state because it has so many other states to contrast withwhen you use favour cogfuncmention you repress cogfuncmention so you wont be able to know your internal state because youre not comparing your own with anyone youre dynamically comparing the ones out there which is why its theatrical and is the best communicator give people what they wantsimilarly for cogfuncmention repressing cogfuncmention youre not aware of your mental state and ignore it instead focusing your concentration outwards onto objects and unchanging scenarios and doesnt see how it evolves over time for instance it doesnt see how a possibility evolves into a solution since cogfuncmention is static and discretely enjoys possibilitiesand to not say im flooding you with sovionics sociofag bs here is a transcript of what is considered as mbtithe nuance of their ability to mirror another personâ s emotional experience can feel like absorbing since itâ s so spot on but remember â this isnâ t another personâ s emotion in the typementionâ s heart this is years and years of the typemention mapping emotions within themselves and finding the closest proximity to what the other person is experiencingsource when they describe the empathy of typementions cogfuncmention they describe it objectively they abosrb emotions thats what they feel and uhm thats it im not comparing anything gt feand i quote i once heard a description for â empathyâ as â œyour pain my heartâ for an typemention this couldnâ t be more true typemention absorb other peopleâ s emotional energy whether they want to or not if itâ s powerful and there â friend or foe intimate or stranger â your pain is in their heart,3.0,74.0,4.0,46.0,92.0

cogfuncmention thinks in mental maps uses spatial reasoning nonverbal nonlinear inductive holistic and treats time as just another spatial dimension it maps out how ideas relate to each other and to the situation and how a situation evolves over time its very visual with heavy use of mental imagerycogfuncmention types make heavy use of the visual cortex the right posterior temporal lobe and spatial memory the same areas anyone uses to create mental maps navigate via landmarks reconstruct events from circumstantial evidence visually recognize the general category of an object visually recognize salient features of an object etcin contrast cogfuncmention uses the frontoparietal network the same areas used to track a squirrel running up a tree so it deals with discrete semantic concepts sequentialbranching logic and precise calculation of trajectories probabilities and balancing of multiple variables cogfuncmention also involves shutting off emotions to think more objectivelycogfuncmention is more about pure symbolic logic and high level integration of abstract information cogfuncmention is more about looking at how fuzzy concepts relate to each other within a spatial contextcogfuncmention is crosscontext and works more like a semantic web of loosely related discrete ideas it kinda works with cogfuncmention in that the connections between ideas are like this reminds me of all these other things so it branches out from one semantic concept into other related concepts monkey banana hands tree jungle climbing tail etc and then from there into more banana fruit yellow sausage tree sunday etc and then even more they can go off on tangents quite easily and im told the sheer mass of ideas can be overwhelming at timescogfuncmention builds theory of mind from the outside in using other peoples reactions as a basis to understand others and itself cogfuncmention types are attentive to peoples emotional state via visual cues facial expressions and body language shut off their emotions to make objective decisions and adjust their behavior to social feedback polite and diplomatic cogfuncmention seems to rely primarily on the left posterior temporal lobe and both anterior temporal lobes but especially the leftcogfuncmention builds theory of mind from the inside out using the cogfuncmention users own experiences as a basis to understand itself and others cogfuncmention types are attentive to peoples emotional state via tone of voice use their emotions as a core basis to make decisions and remain authentic to their personal values and beliefs high integrity cogfuncmention seems to rely primarily on the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and both anterior temporal lobes but especially the rightcogfuncmention uses episodic memory to compare the current situation to past events its much more sequential atomistic and detailoriented than cogfuncmention cogfuncmention uses both posterior temporal lobes but especially the left and cogfuncmentiondoms use the visual cortex as well but more to recall information than to project forwardyou might find these links helpful dario nardiâ s neuroscience of personality cogfuncmention cogfuncmention cogfuncmention cogfuncmention cogfuncmention cogfuncmention cogfuncmention cogfuncmention its as if typemention are using their gpu instead of their cpu to figure out problems,12.0,84.0,7.0,53.0,54.0

huh why how cogfuncmention regards interpersonal relationshipsintroversion by definition deals with subjective data that is if you took 10 individuals put them in a room and forced them to do a task that required their introverted functions then they would all get different results but if extraverted functions were used then theyll all get a similar result i would cite something from jungs psychological types but ive been searching for 10 minutes and i still dont find it then feeling deals with exchange of energy between entities feelings more specifically anything that can be classified as goodevil now introverted feeling cogfuncmention deals with the subjective part of it relationships are subjective not every person on the planet interacts with everyone else the same way psychological distance is another cogfuncmention thing you dont act the same way with everyone etc cogfuncmention is aware of the ratio of the energy of states like the ratio of my emotional state with yours then i can use it to finetune the wavelength and adjust psychological distance eg politenesswhere cogfuncmention dynamic tests just the energy of the state and can influence it using their own emotions thats why socionics calls it emotion whereas for cogfuncmention relation cogfuncmention is hyper aware of its emotional state because it has so many other states to contrast withwhen you use favour cogfuncmention you repress cogfuncmention so you wont be able to know your internal state because youre not comparing your own with anyone youre dynamically comparing the ones out there which is why its theatrical and is the best communicator give people what they wantsimilarly for cogfuncmention repressing cogfuncmention youre not aware of your mental state and ignore it instead focusing your concentration outwards onto objects and unchanging scenarios and doesnt see how it evolves over time for instance it doesnt see how a possibility evolves into a solution since cogfuncmention is static and discretely enjoys possibilitiesand to not say im flooding you with sovionics sociofag bs here is a transcript of what is considered as mbtithe nuance of their ability to mirror another personâ s emotional experience can feel like absorbing since itâ s so spot on but remember â this isnâ t another personâ s emotion in the typementionâ s heart this is years and years of the typemention mapping emotions within themselves and finding the closest proximity to what the other person is experiencingsource when they describe the empathy of typementions cogfuncmention they describe it objectively they abosrb emotions thats what they feel and uhm thats it im not comparing anything gt feand i quote i once heard a description for â empathyâ as â œyour pain my heartâ for an typemention this couldnâ t be more true typemention absorb other peopleâ s emotional energy whether they want to or not if itâ s powerful and there â friend or foe intimate or stranger â your pain is in their heart,3.0,74.0,4.0,46.0,92.0

as far as what is magic i agree that the very idea of magic is far better as a nebulous thing without constraints however when you start inserting something so poorly described into a story then you can lose a sense of tension and find yourself in situations where you have deus ex machina as the go to response to whatever situation your characters are in for example in lotr the vagueness of magic is only kept from ruining the story through the apathy of the higher powers in the universe literally ruling that gandalf and the other wizards cant use the majority of their powers and thus preventing them ruining the story this combined with the fact only 5 wizards exist in middle earth you understand that almost everything has to be done in a mundane way by more or less mundane characters i would argue that youre wrong about how well described the magic system is in hp which frankly is an awfully designed magic system and the magic has all kinds of horrific implications mostly because everyone thinks they know how magic works when in actuality no one has any idea this has lead to the sections of the novels where they are contradicting themselves or previous rules biggest thing that jumps to mind is the wand ownership fiasco that occurred towards the later books also while im ranting about hp that guy reading a brief history of time could have just cast a charm on his finger to stir his teaas an aside i would love to debate you about how well described the eva universe actually is that even though not much is explained there are enough principles presented to allow everyone to make reasonable connections between each stepim actually a really big fan of hard fantasy your well describedmagic universes so most of my favourite novels are exactly not what youre looking for but some of the less well described stories malazan book of the fallen by steven erikson an epic fantasy so large that youll need spreadsheets just to keep track of every character wheel of time by robert jordan it becomes more regimented in the later books when brandon sanderson took over btw he writes amazing hard fantasy,85.0,95.0,15.0,50.0,15.0

the other ladies gave a bunch of great responses i 100 agree with its interesting to see how other typemention ladies feel the same like me about having a friend to come home to someone relaxed who will be honest with you and keep you grounded no emotional games or drama just being able to come home be home and leave all your stress at the door which also means your so doesnt make an issue of your work and career is really just chill about it and everything else concerning our overly ambitious characters i find this interesting because this type of man arent usually the overly ambitious guys like we are at least not to the same level and intensity as we are it balances us out i guess but for some reason i still have a stereotypical idea in my head about us strong typemention women belonging in some kind of power couple relationship with an equally ambitious man i realize now after so much time with my more laidback so that wouldnt make me happy though,2.0,92.0,31.0,60.0,53.0

if you are interested in overclocking i might suggest watching jay2cents video about using msi afterburner i was able to push the voltage slight on my card 36mv and im running stable at 1400mhz on air with temps under 80ca few bits to share from my experience i could push the card a little higher but the gpu really didnt like being above 80c and would eventually become unstable after a little over an hour of stress testing finding the balance between audible tolerance and temperature is going to be highly subjective personally i dont mind keeping mine at about 95 fan speed as my rig is fairly loud as is and it keeps my card idling at about 29cmany people will suggest underclocking as a great way to extend the life value of your card its possible to maintain 1338mhz by undervolting your card slightly but the return on this effort will largely be up to your own expectationsat 1440p i maintain an average of about 52 fps on games like the witcher 3 gta v and star citizen i wouldnt recommend the card for 1440 if you do not plan on pushing a fairly high oc but for 1080p this is a nifty card to have in your rigenjoy,17.0,89.0,7.0,80.0,39.0

i wasnt offended dont worry confused yesi misinterpreted your intent if you are wondering if i think that is an accurate description of cogfuncmention then i will break it downfirst this is accurate in the way that cogfuncmention doms will attempt to understand you i think a better phrasing would be nobody will try to understand themselves as deeply as an cogfuncmention dom cogfuncmention doms will be able to understand others by seeking an emotion that they have once felt and relating that to the other persons emotional situation in the end its more about understand their own emotions more than it is trying to understand the other persons authentic emotionsi understood the you to mean the cogfuncmention dom if it was referring to a cogfuncmention dom then yes id say that is true otherwise maybe but again only in the way that they are understanding the person to the best of their abilities by thinking about what theyve personally experiencedabsolutelyid say this could almost apply to both cogfuncmention and cogfuncmentionyeah id agree with thisid say this is more so cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention actually i think an cogfuncmention dom is capable of feeling deep empathy but its always in relation to their own feelings they blend it and carry it around with them lose themselves i highly doubt itcogfuncmention seeks to understand and accept you exactly as you are and help you develop according to your own goals and valueswhat matters is the emphasis on mature cogfuncmention user i believe mature cogfuncmention users are highly capable and prone to this behavior i can see how it would be taken as cogfuncmentionoverall i get what they are saying it seemed like almost more than anything an cogfuncmention creation of what they want to believe cogfuncmention is the entire tone of this is incredibly cogfuncmention but not the best description of it i perceived the cogfuncmention nature of itnot as much the specificity of word choicephrasingi was expanding on what my knowledge of cogfuncmention is that wasnt included in that because i assumed you were wanting further confirmation from me that i truly do not see cogfuncmention working within my mindwhat types have you considered when straying from typementionsorry if i came off as harsh i simply felt like my entire explanation had been disregarded and not taken seriously honestlyim excited to see the final results,61.0,73.0,54.0,17.0,20.0

ok whew lots of thoughts heregenerally with kids with autism ive worked with and most kids for that matter more preplanning and practice makes for better outcomes mom should have known better than to throw him in the play at the last minute the teacher should have made expectations more clear maybe they could have compromised and agreed on some other part with clearer expectations or agreed that maybe he could start practicing for the xmas play in a week why was he permitted to have a part saying thanksgiving thanksgiving if he was told he would have a non speaking part why was he then permitted a speaking part if he snuck it in why didnt they have a plan in place if he went off script ex have a teachers aide direct him to the right area for the next scene mixed message city if controlling the mic with all the kids was an issue then dont put the mic in a mic stand have an adult control who says what or shut the mic off when its not to be used most importantly because ive had autisticnon verbal students be deliberately and arguably illegally excluded from certain school events i want to know why caleb wasnt planned to be in the play from the getgoif this was me i would have had a proactive conversation with the parents what do you as a parent expect out of this last minute add to the play do we think he can handle it what is his history of being able to handle other schoolwide events can we provide an aide visual cues anything to help him be more sure of his job in the playin this case i disagree with the teacher the overall negative impact the way it appeared to hurt caleb as compared to allowing him another speaking line was not worth taking the mic away it was made worse imo because she left him up there alone it wasnt even that he was hidden in a group of kids it was so noticeable do i believe that teacher grabbed the mic to control the situation and did not look at or think about what would cause the least stress to caleb yes its her body language that in my opinion is an adult moving hastily to gain control she should have checked herself am i trying to gain control here is this best for caleb will it ruin the play if he says gobble gobble of course not what if worst case scenario he cusses is it really that big of a deal my need to have control needs to take a backseat for the kid and for the overall performance does she deserve death threats no could they all stand to learn a bit more about planning yes the mother looks like an absolute helicopter parent she is going to have to work on her advocacy skills first thing would be improving communication with the teachers and being more proactive rather than reactive for her child if her child was on my caseload i would keep as close an eye on her as i would her child those parents can turn anything into a litigious nightmare in about two secondsas is their rightbut im gonna make sure i cover my ass every which way from sunday,57.0,80.0,86.0,79.0,55.0

its easy to get this idea that youre a mix of things because of the way that tests give your result but thats not really how mbti works youre one or the other like someone said it could just be that youre developing your inferior cogfuncmention function you mistyped originally or youre not fully understanding questionscharacteristics about these types id say take as many tests as you can and really think about your answers are they what you actually do or is it just how you like to think of yourself i typed as typemention for a while before i realized that i am really not a thinker in the way that i thought i was its very possible that youve made a similar error in judgement it also may help for you to read about the cognitive functions and decide which you most closely identify withedit this post is really helpful for understanding how it all works,70.0,96.0,15.0,37.0,80.0

im an engineer myself so i need a lot of math and it was a requirement for entry into my degree programme my uni did a large scale analysis of which factors can be a predictor of academic success the biggest surprise was that how well a student does in high school maths is a very strong predictor for how well the student will do at university this held true across all disciplines even stuff like art history degrees so we wondered why would this be to me its clear maths learns you determination and learning how to critically think reflect and analyse stuff on a highly abstract level all of these are qualities you need for not only stem degrees but also arts degrees which require to you to think creatively but still require a very analytical approach of that creative process to truly understand it so no you might not need maths when you want to make films but you will need the skills learning maths teaches you to become truly good at what you do,46.0,27.0,31.0,10.0,84.0

perceiving functionsthe four perceiving functions to absorb information arecogfuncmention extroverted intuition cogfuncmention introverted intuition cogfuncmention extroverted sensing cogfuncmention introverted sensing the two intuition functions are preoccupied with what could be while the two sensing functions are preoccupied with what is your five senses i will go through cogfuncmention vs cogfuncmention first and then explain cogfuncmention vs cogfuncmentionni vs ne as i said both of these functions are preoccupied with what could be the difference is cogfuncmention is extroverted external while cogfuncmention is introverted internalcogfuncmention sees an object a thing a single piece of information and has a sort of explosion of ideas of what it could expand to in the future cogfuncmention sees a million ways a thing can develop in the future cogfuncmention is the opposite cogfuncmention gathers a million pieces of information cogfuncmention is preoccupied always with the big picture only to see a single way that it could develop in the future now cogfuncmention is sometimes ironically called black magic but i want to make clear that it cant blindly predict the future like witches what it does is noticing patterns of how things evolved through time in the past and applying it to the futureexample i had an typemention cogfuncmention over cogfuncmention tell me that when they were 4 years old they found confusing how children had to be explained to not touch the hot stove the cogfuncmention user saw that in the past it went from a little red to much more and more redish as seconds passed so when they saw that it got a little red they got reminded instantly of the pattern and realized that in the future it will get hotter and hotter so they dont have to touch it now this is very basic 4 year old cogfuncmention anyone with a little brain can do this at a reasonable age but a 4 year old that is not a cogfuncmention user should be alarmed about these things now the ultimate question can cogfuncmention see in the future basically yes this kid saw in the future what will happen with the hot stove so basically it can but not in the superstitious way everyone thinks it does it is not black magiccogfuncmention is good at brainstorming it works like an explosion of ideas while cogfuncmention is always focused on one thing cogfuncmention simply cant focus on one path in the future since it sees a million paths that idea can grow into i heard about cogfuncmention users that they are very undecided of what they want to do in the future they see a hundred career paths that they could go into and they donâ t know which one to choose cogfuncmention users are pretty sure of what they want to do in the future most of the time they usually have 123 things they obsess on over the course of their lives and become perfectionists also cogfuncmention is comparing every individual element to how it relates to others think about math or physics generally to get a full result you need an unit of measure cogfuncmention doesnâ t work in an unit of measure do you know the famous mem â œbanana for scaleâ thing well cogfuncmention never has a â œscaleâ that scale is added by an extroverted judging function trying to bring cogfuncmention to reality usefulness cogfuncmention is only comparing objects it has its own scales but not relating to the real world letâ s think about the universe for a little if cogfuncmention had the whole universe in its system it can use any object in the universe as scale but when working in the real universe it has to be postprocesses by cogfuncmention or cogfuncmention to be accurate internal frame of the world actual world for cogfuncmention â œmore specifically it wonders how a perceived theme fits with all the other perceived themes or how all these different sequences of interactions fit together to contrast it with cogfuncmention cogfuncmention wonders about specific sequences of interactions it focuses on the idea itself and where it leads cogfuncmention doesnt care all that much about where any specific idea leads it cares about how it interacts with all the other ideas the trajectory you get from cogfuncmention is because the way different sequences of interactions interact with one another is a process of elimination youre left with less and less probable options the more themes you throw into the picture a best drawn line is naturally createdâ source similarly isnt essences of objects everything you have any comprehension of is an essence an abstraction are cogfuncmention doms generally interested in what makes an apple an apple of course not who cares what specifically goes into the categorization of an apple its an apple the specifics of what makes it an apple is of no relevance or interest now if an cogfuncmention dom on the other hand had thought a lot about culture they might wonder what the apple symbolically represents within said culture and why what is it about it that gives it that symbolic representation what does it have in common or what separates it from other symbolic representations of similar objects they might also wonder about how the concept of categorization relates to information processing what does it say about our information processing or neither of those might be interesting thoughts because theyre obsessed about something completely different and couldnt care less about culture or information processingcogfuncmention only cares about essences in the context of how does this relate to my overall perspective how does it relate to everything else ive seen experienced and imagined what connects a fish a donkey and horse poop is probably not a very interesting question and a cogfuncmention dom isnt going to try to find the essence connecting those 3 because it has no relevance to themâ source also cogfuncmention sees the world in symbols and metaphors its metaphors and analogies are subjective to the self because as carl jung said not quote just what i remember from memory â œan introverted intuitor canâ t share these visions to the world it would make people think heâ s crazy for example i had a patient once come to me once and she was like â œi got a snake in my stomachâ and i was like â œwtfâ and she was like â œyeah thereâ s a snake in my stomachâ and i was like â œhow tf can a snake be in your stomachâ and she was like â œoh wait itâ s not an actual snake but if feels like oneâ source the â œthingâ here cogfuncmention has its own metaphors that arenâ t very objective and accessible to the world like the cogfuncmention metaphors are cogfuncmention is comparing the stomach pain to everything the user felt and thought in hisher life and immediately saw a connection between snakes and pain using â œsnakesâ as a metaphor for pain unfortunately the user forgot to postprocess it with cogfuncmention for typemention or cogfuncmention with typemention and people thought she was crazypatterns now i said that the way cogfuncmention has their path into the future is through seeing patterns of how events happened through time but how do you think cogfuncmention knows all these different ways a situation can go they do that too while cogfuncmention sees patterns in the internal world of an idea focused on how a single idea evolved through time cogfuncmention sees patterns in the external world around them finding the hidden meaning behind and inbetween things â œreading through the linesâ they see interconnections in the external world of an idea how the idea relates to other ideas and how everything is connected and how it could go in the future cogfuncmention instead sees how other external ideas and factors influenced the idea through time and how it got to this present point paths also i would like to talk a little about paths and time cogfuncmention is described as having a set path that it must follow with a clear but unknown destination they have this gut feeling that this is the way it goes like thereâ s some sort of â œlight at the end of the roadâ without knowing what the light gives them they have a clear set destination that is unknown cogfuncmention as always is reversed cogfuncmention sees the end goals very clearly and has no clear â œpathâ they have a million paths that they can follow and they want to get to know and experience all of them cogfuncmention has the destination as the end result and the path there is the starting point cogfuncmention has the destinations as a starting point and the path is the end result puzzle analogy imagine a puzzle cogfuncmention is having most of the puzzle done especially the corners thats what it needs and fills what is missing cogfuncmention has the center pieces thats what it needs and slowly goes in all the ways to fill the puzzle cogfuncmention is very good to see what is missing while cogfuncmention is good to see what could be,3.0,74.0,4.0,46.0,92.0

thank you this is all good stuff i had an inkling that your interpretation oftypementions tertiary would look like you said in my comment to peppermint when i said i kind of tried to limit myself here a bit in this post i do know some typemention but one is diagnosed with whatever they are calling multiple personality disorder these days who i havent spoken to in many many years and the other is my oneday motherinlaw so i wanted to keep any personal biases out here and focus on what i could find fromtypementions own experience there wasnt as much to be found as with typemention though so i know that it is slanted in that direction i also tried to keep it more focused on the to be wealthy thing but i find that kind of hard to do since that doesnt really say a whole lot ive been thinking a lot about the demonstrative lately and tried to tie that in here i was wondering what you thought of that as i think that has to pay a significant part of some of these unconscious drives like to be wealthy actually originate from ive always found the descriptions of the id functions very lacking but here and there ill find a piece of speculation that makes the demonstrative especially seem really interesting and significant it might be a tough job but im think that maybe there is a similar thing going on with the demonstrative as with the hidden agenda like with cogfuncmention it might be there is inherent meaning in the world or something like that i have quite a few ideas about all this but there isnt much to go on other than you dismiss it youre good at it it comprises your worldview and connection to the collective unconscious but nothing really adequately explains it for me,70.0,92.0,81.0,7.0,5.0

you seem to be doing a fine job as is i will just say this dont forget that a relationship is a two way street be vigilant that your needs are not categorically swept under the rug because things are challenging right nowwe need a reminder every now and then that taking our so for granted is a recipe for disaster best way to do that is reminding him that you have needs too and what those needs are avoid the pitfall that he turns into a guy who just happens to live under the same roof as you is he still attentive to what you need do you get to share time with him where your emotional needs are met if not remind him that despite things being draining you need a bit of loving toothe joys of living with an typemention is that you can just bluntly enumerate what you need of him keep it short and sweet though and devoid of feelings unless your typemention has developed past the i have no feelings state in which case you can be a bit more youuse your intuition with this advice though i am not quite representative as an typemention anymore on account of having been in a relationship with a feeler typemention for 145 years now that is 145 years of learning how to accommodate the needs of another type,30.0,31.0,21.0,17.0,17.0

this is actually very interesting and undoubtedly helpful for others with a similar functional structure with lower level ji functions especially when they are in the inferior position tend to make it difficult to see or understand oneself clearly what you are doing here is making this internal subjective perspective of your self externalized and viewed from the outside in the objective manner that you are more comfortable with it is as if you are able to step outside your body and evaluate the self as an object and determine how you feel about the object it mirrors the type of behavior that cogfuncmention doms do compulsively which is understand themselves internally very well but are mostly oblivious to how they present themselves this same method of watching old videos of yourself may not just prove helpful for those that dont quite understand their internal state but also for those that dont quite understand how others perceive them such as ixxps as they can see how they look to other people,70.0,92.0,81.0,7.0,5.0

so i think that your interest in working out a lot and having a good physique plus starting mma is a stereotypical indication of cogfuncmention it seems like you use your cogfuncmention primarily with an cogfuncmention goal or plan in mind as you say that you are not as efficient when it comes to achieving them so that would suggest that either lower level cogfuncmention or maybe lower level cogfuncmention or both it is also in your sentence structure as more of concrete tone without the ramble of cogfuncmention i get the judging axes wrong more than the perceiving so i could be wrong here when you say that your main goal as of right now is to increase my value to society sounds like an cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention statement to me cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention is about making concrete your visionary will as michael pierce puts it rather than being more wired to seek abstract knowledge,70.0,92.0,81.0,7.0,5.0

its definitely a cogfuncmention thing from what ive read here we all have a pretty good idea of who we are as people and what we believe in but how we decide to express that externally is completely fluid and contextual typemention seem to have a tendency to seek out and promote balance in social interactions so if someone is weak we provide the strength if someone is strong we fade back and play support we are aware of what the situation calls for and the power dynamic and have no problem playing different roles without even having to think about it now some may feel that perhaps that means we are disingenuous or inconsistent but i think that kind of adaptability is incredibly useful think of it like types of matter some people are solids and cant change they are exactly what they are and fit in or dont fit in depending on their shape some people are airy and flighty and incredibly hard to pin down were liquid and change to fit the shape of the interaction at hand were still ourselves just rearranged to be the most effective or appropriate,83.0,80.0,46.0,37.0,14.0

hmm it depends which tesco you go to im super picky and do not eat processed food that has been reconstituted or include chemical ingredients when i was in the uk i mainly shopped at waitrose or mamps my favourite and lidl for the basics dairy fruitveghowever i found tesco to be reasonably priced and offer a good range of items the one i lived near had a fresh bakery butcher deli fishmonger fresh produce and decent sandwiches section they also had those scan as you shop thingiesin the aisles chocolate orange juice etc they offered the brand names then tesco finest which is often better than the brand name for the same price then the own brand which is almost as good as the brand name for far cheaper or value which i dont touch so i could easily buy quality things eg i would never skimp on bread and buy cheap things at the same time kitchen rolls etc in comparison the local sainsburys was terrible despite having a wide range i couldnt find anything i liked it was mostly processed brand name food or their basics range which was 20 more expensive than tescos or a very limited range of top shelf items which was 30 more expensive,45.0,92.0,54.0,62.0,9.0
i was going to say cogfuncmention dominants as well i recall as a child what i now understand to be repressing my cogfuncmention i tried to relate to the world in terms of cogfuncmention but it was essentially rejected or at least i perceived it that way and consequently introverted more i put on the cogfuncmention role mask to act like i didnt care i would think the reverse would be true of a cogfuncmention dom that initially is more comfortable trying out their cogfuncmention but others do not see their inner value so they have to put on the exaggerated cogfuncmention role to be seen and get the attention to validate their inferior cogfuncmention and support their cogfuncmention goals i think the opposite situation will occur around adolescence when a child learns that their dominant goals arent working as well as they had hoped and the auxiliary gets more attention as an alternative all your peers are developing in personality not to mention physically so one is compelled to differentiate themselves to keep up and stand out as an individual identity i recall a significant shift in my personality around eighth grade that was a childish expression of emergent cogfuncmention and thus a trying on of extroversion for a while further development of the role function should happen here as a child not only wishes to be different but appear different and shape what that perception of the self is going to be with my completely subjective experience in mind and the basic idea of how functions develop in mind i think to answer ops question it would most likely depend if the behavior seems to stick then it would be an extroverted type if the behavior is more like a phase perhaps it is an introvert attempting to compensate for their lack of connection to the outside world just like anything in typology it requires context and a careful observation of patterns,70.0,92.0,81.0,7.0,5.0

its a fair question yet something that i have difficulty with to explain i was raised outside of serbia and although my parents mother didnt explicitly raise me based on a strong serbian heritage it has been a constant factor throughout my life as i was raised with the serbian language i visited church often as a child many family members still live in the balkans who we visit often my grandparents own lands and houses passed down many generations etc my mother decided not to claim citizenship for me or for herself as when yugoslavia fell shed been living in our home country for a long time and also gained citizenship of this country and decided it wasnt worth it to her and felt rather strongly that i in that case also shouldnt get citizenship however i cant explain it but as i grew older i simultaneously got more connected to my serbian heritage and how it influenced my through out my childhood while also getting more disconnected to it as without my parentsmother i didnt have any tangible roots there it kept eating at me this feeling of uncertainty confusion and also a feeling a pride for my background i couldnt place i felt my mother by deciding i shouldnt get citizenship took something from me that actually did belong to me once i found out i could only claim citizenship through decent until my 23rd i believe i just decided i wanted to do this as in the end all i had to loose was some time and moneythat being said i travel a lot as well and i must admit having visa free access to countries like russia and china does have its benefits,50.0,85.0,15.0,50.0,30.0

its not really a problem with management who are deciding on who to hire actually many european universities have policies in place which highly favour women in stem fields to a point you may very well say its discriminating although yes these fields usually have less then 20 women in any scientific position thats higher than a post doc level my own university has research institutes that have none actually this actually causes problems with regard to work environment and providing role models for students so why are there so little women in academia no science to back this up but my own experiences tell me that many women actually want to be in academia as the number of female phd students is actually quite high maybe not 5050 yet for engineering in my country but still quite good however when you want your career to progress in academia you need to be able to handle the work load and stress that comes with really devoting your life to your research and you are also required work abroad for multiple years before getting being able to become a professor at least in europe if you want a position at a decent university after you get in at an assistant professor level it is still a very competitive environment everything is measured the amount of phds you have how much grant money you bring in citation indexes and number of papers everything you want to become an associate professor sure go ahead if you meet the minimum requirements you want to be full professor well we only have room for 1 full prof for every 23 associates and really if you are not good enough to be a full prof most universities kick you out eventually because there are assistant professor waiting to take your spot which have more potential worklife balance in academia is absolutely awful and i believe this is the reason why there are so little women in academia however once you get in which is also something i personally experienced you are very much respected and treated as equal well some of the computing science and physics men in their men cave offices need to be told to store away their nude calendar posters once they have a female phd joining them but thats about it,46.0,27.0,31.0,10.0,84.0

sorry that this isnt totally relevant but kurzgesagt is fucking amazing ive watched all their videos and they really capture how i see the worldi get the sense it has a very cogfuncmentioncogfuncmentioncogfuncmention viewpoint the cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention permeates most of their videos as they quickly enthusiastically and carefully tell you about the subject of their video but then the cogfuncmention always comes near the end when they realize theyve enthusiastically told you something really bleak and they try to make you feel better ive done the same thing irl when explaining to a friend what cancer actually isbut to the op get that physics degree dooo iiittt its super satisfying perhaps going to school and really learning a lot everyday is a good way to break the feeling of stagnation as bleak as even the two videos you linked might seem i think theyre a genuinely beautiful and compelling view of the world an elegant and mathematical world defined by statistics and geometry which produce layers of complexity and abstraction physics and the sciences that build on top of it is the entry point into an amazing picture that defies our everyday experience yet which defines itnature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns so each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry richard feynman,30.0,70.0,15.0,15.0,50.0

i think that you are right about the nostalgia cycle but as someone that is also old enough to remember exactly what you are talking about 36 there are some differences i would say that nirvana never really lost their relevance or lost their cool when compared against bands that are still together or reformed like pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chains none of them have anywhere near the following as nirvana has always had i love all of those bands and like their new material but i dont think the nostalgia phenomenon really applies as well to nirvana id compare them more to our generations beatles or black sabbath i remember the resurgence of the doors queen the eagles and a lot of the classic rock bands of the 60s70s but they werent very enduring waynes world made queen popular again oliver stone and eddie vedder revived the doors etc but most of those bands had faded into obscurity before becoming relevant again i dont think nirvana was ever a joke like the eagles,70.0,92.0,81.0,7.0,5.0

i dont think sadness is normal but i think cogfuncmentioncogfuncmentions awareness of the human condition can make melancholy fairly common in the sense that youre aware of the inherently dire nature of being alive but that doesnt necessarily lead to a depressive state but often compassion and understanding you can see what i mean in this video about the value of melancholy i think if theres chronic sadness one might want to consider talking to a therapist although hyperaware of emotions typemention can often have a very analytical interior life so much so that a constant depressive state might be noteworthy as a mental health issue that shouldnt be ignored,83.0,80.0,46.0,37.0,14.0

so basically there is an unconscious dark side to every unvaluedshadow function ignoring demonstrative trickster role while the valuedmain stack of functions have only a normal conscious side i only know about the two sides of the 8th function 3rd function in model a the conscious part is what socionics defined as role function and its basically training wheels for your inferior or cheating to not face your inferior because it is only used to get out of negative situations short way out sort of thing all the negative emotions experienced are repressed in the unconscious thus becoming the most negative function out there the demonic or devilish function beebe focused on am i right then i guess there are two sides of the coin of every function,3.0,74.0,4.0,46.0,92.0

thank you my father is doing as well as he can he retired which was best for him he is doing much better than his negative doctors ever expected we all went to hawaii last year it was a dream my parents had their entire marriage but never acted on because oh we will do it laterwe dont have the money they did they are workaholic tight wads well you can imagine how my mother felt watching her husband die in front of her and later was almost swept away my clotdvt was the entire length of my right leg i couldnt walk for 2 months if i would have waited 1 more day to see my doctor i only waited about half a day as it got bigger and bigger he said i would have died it sure does cause one to reflect on life when you have a possible time bomb ticking in your body im sure others who have had significant illnessed can appreciate this terrible feeling the track i needed to get on was appreciating life more i was already a gogetter type but i realized i was doing a lot of catering to others that was taking a toll on me i cut ties with some people and ended a long relationship that was going nowhere i uprooted my entire life after my dad came home and i got well i saw a path to get out i did not like my employer or the town i lived in i started to plan and it took me a few years but now i am in a much better place but i had to go through the bad part first and clean my life of burdens as far as love i got real blunt i did the rebound thing for a little bit it was fun but then i straight up told people i dated what my expectations were i figured if the guy couldnt handle some bluntness and morbidity then he probably wasnt for me accepting my family and the issues my dad has now was massive too i found when i finally stood my ground and had my self respect in place i found a great guy everyone before him was so much damn work because i was trying to fit with men i didnt fit with i see so many people mostly women but not entirely trying to change the person they are dating no be up front if it doesnt work say thanks but no and go on to the next one life is too short for half assed relationshipsi tend to be an idealist and some people roll their eyes or whatever i get that not everything can be perfect i get that not everything is under my control but if i can make decisions big or small to get to feel really happy with my life im going to do it,57.0,80.0,86.0,79.0,55.0

awesome about two weeks ago i visited a church in my home city where handel supposedly wrote the messiah it premiered here they have his organ its a beautiful thing with gold gilding and carved cherub faces unfortunately not allowed to play it what era the baroque era i believe the convention is to end the baroque era with the death of bach idk who lived longer they were born in the same year i think but pretty sure bach was alive for xerxes fairly certain handel is 100 baroque the following period is classical capital c which is basically just the sons of bach haydn and mozart really dont think anything by handel belongs in the same group as them handel is the quintessential baroque operatistof course not there are transitional figures at the tailends of movements and sometimes composers just experiment there were transitional figures between baroque and classical i would consider the sons of bach to be such i dont think handel was one of them naturally bachs sons were younger than handel just like beethoven is considered to be the transition between classical and romantic i would consider handel and js bach to be the pinnacle the apotheosis of baroque music and after them it couldnt do anything else and needed to become something new handel for opera bach for everything else pretty much every form that existed at the time,38.0,86.0,10.0,3.0,69.0

i completely agree what you ask sounds reminiscent of stanley milgram amp phillip zimbardos work on obedience amp authority social psychologists amp sociologists would be the ones to test whether society could change as drastically as you suggest amp even if the results were conclusive theyll always be one that brands psychology amp sociology as pseudoscience amp completely ignores what it suggests which is sadunfortunately it might be hard to people to partake in those experiments because of the effect that julian rotters locus of control unknowingly has on them rotters loc describes how much control amp influence an individual feels they have on a situation milgrams agency theory also entwines with rotters loc theory in this context as milgram states that we have two states 1 agentic amp 2 autonomous in the agentic state we relinquish our free will amp obey someones orders in the autonomous state we act upon our own free will eg using these theories when rigid social convention allowing women the vote abolishing slavery was up for discussion rotter amp milgram would probably argue that people thought it couldnt amp wouldnt change because they didnt feel as if they could control the situation they couldnt have any influence over it they were in an agentic state using modern terminology they wouldve held that view because its not in their back garden,86.0,45.0,25.0,59.0,67.0

it is possible in dota 2 if they use around the same netcode and protocols as csbecause of the rendering technique urakijah has explained it to you already for ingame use ill explain it to you for external usecsgo sends information packets with information in them everyone gets these packets the players and the people on gotv although people on gotv get them delayed packets are structured in a specific way and contains information on the game state kinda like player1playernameteampositionxpositionypositionzfor xray as a spectator for example you need to get the coordinates of all players to display their position with the outline so the position data of all people will be sent to everyone on the server with each update every 015s on 64 and 007s on 128 tick as you may guess you have the position of all people then so all you have to do is to write a program that takes the packages and reads out the positions and displays them on the mapthe mm servers are 64 tick because 128 tick in mm is less beneficial for the larger number of players so why waste money on servers that give a huge advantage to one part of the playersi dont know how you get to say money issue but whateverthe community concepts are giving a single person too much power in this game for one part and for the other part are mostly ridiculous and not realisticthere was someone writing about encoding memory in games and decoding it as you need it the drawback is you need extremely powerful computers to do that and if such computers exist you can also cheat again so a lot is on the behalf of i wish there was a solution like xpeople are walling because they have fun cheating either they are not good enough and want to play easy mode or just want to ruin the games for others cheat coders like the challenge to write software that isnt detected or just to earn moneyyou wont get rid of these people in online games especially in fps as there is such a wide range of cheats you can create and usesomething you may want to read,2.0,92.0,31.0,60.0,53.0

well that makes sense i think i can understand why typemention are more comfortable with ahonestly i get more of an cogfuncmention feel from b than i do a the first statement to me in a speaks to more cogfuncmention than anything imo standing up for a topic you are passionate about to me speaks to the individual holding their views as objective rather than subjective it is going im right because ive figured out the world cogfuncmention an cogfuncmention person might also want others to agree with them and for the group to commune comparative to a that is recognizing the many alternative viewpoints and expressing your own without trying to change othersi think cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention might possibly avoid trying to affect the emotions of others because they might be avoidant of personal discomfort i think cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention might not worry about others being comfortable as they want their ideas to be acceptedfurthermore judging people and sorting them into categories sounds more cogfuncmention to me im very nonjudgmental and the idea of doing so i cant agree with at all furthermore the last line is about confronting them and to me that speaks to wanting group conformityi could see it also being cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention lacking the cogfuncmention sfps might care less about their own comfort and to them their viewpoint is the focus rather than the nfp who is considering all viewpoints through a subjective manner the sfp feel strongly about the world and willing to stand up for it furthermore this i think is based upon their cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention worldview while cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention might see multiple viewpoints and accept them as all possibly valid and thus not push things cogfuncmentioncogfuncmention i would think would be more concerned with their personal subjective viewpoint thus if something conflicts with it it clashesthat is my analysis anyhow,98.0,40.0,1.0,1.0,99.0

its not so much ubuntu the still linux distro that i dislike but canonical as the parent company ubuntu is always very much portrayed as a community project but over the years it has become clear it is very much a corporate thing it is canonical calling the shots which i am fine with as they pay for it but they should just stop with all of the community bullshit ubuntu is what canonical says it is and all the espoused community fuzzies is just marketingubuntu is not about bringing linux computing to everybody it is about carving out as much space for canonical as possible which goes as far as developing incompatible technologies in house to capture and keep developers in the ubuntu fold good for them but i view it as detrimental to being a linux user what canonical is building is a canonical os im not a canonical os user im a linux user,30.0,31.0,21.0,17.0,17.0

socionics as well as mbti based models do not work on a spectrum but rather they are based on dichotomies according to the theory there are such a thing as subtypes in socionics i personally think subtypes are unnecessary but they are accepted by many socionists the most common division is between those that favor their dominant intjcogfuncmention for example or their auxiliary typementioncogfuncmention but there are many other possible subtypes so in that sense it is sort of like middle types but they are still defined functionally or dichotomously if i were to accept the idea of subtypes i would think that they are not permanent as functional development will change the expression of your functional use as for your other examples borderline ns or tf if not due to testing inaccuracies is due to one not becoming aware of all their functions as they enter the consciousness gradually this is less a socionics concept as it a jungian concept called differentiation of the functions through a process of individuation a borderline pj or ie is in reality impossible except for the reasons just mentioned but here it is much more problematic because it would alter your dominant orientation and primary means of interpreting the world so called ambiversion is already accounted for in the theory and a shift or unbalance between p and j would very distressing for the psyche now when it comes to how this would relate to the superego block would be that you over or underidentify with your persona the persona is the mask that you wear to serve as a means of interacting with the outside world while protecting the delicate portions of your personality the superid this is how the role function gets its name it the role that you default to in uncomfortable situations and is a socially agreed upon role that you and everyone else plays roles that you play are son father banker customer preacher student etc it is how you are supposed to act when you dont know the full context of a situation only the superficial aspect of it when you are comfortable in a situation you then let your guard down and act as an ego or the real you or let others in how this relates to the topic here is sometimes forget that they are wearing a mask and get stuck with it on all the time think of the teacher that never stops instructing people outside of the classroom and forgets that there is more to them than just their job their sense of identity gets wrapped up in this construct this explains why an typemention may think they are an inxp because they overidentify with their role cogfuncmention perhaps because that is the role they play as a student and they want the world to see them as logical underidentification on the other hand will bring about contents of the id this will come off as less borderline and more hardline here the t function for example will be very absolutist in its thinking and increasing becomes more closeminded and extreme,70.0,92.0,81.0,7.0,5.0

ive read your entire post and i see what point youre trying to makebut i disagree with multiple of your pointslets start with your argument that rba never questioned their actions may i ask why you think they didnt what if they did question their actions and came to the conclusion that they had to finish the mission no matter what because its simply both rationally and morally the only valid course of actionyes theyve hurt people yes theyve killed people theyve butchered thousands and watched them burn theyve separated families theyve crippled children theyve ruined a nation theyve committed every horror known to man aside of rapebut you know whati would have done the same even now that i know the people in walldia their history their hopes their dreams and their legacyid still do the sameyes what they did was horrible if you look at it from the point of view how its represented to us but the numbers dont lie as far as they know the thread from walldia to release the wall titans and crush the world was real and to be honest we have no confirmation that it isntthe lives of the people of the wallscompared to the lives of the rest of the planeta few millionagainst a few billionyes i give it to you eren also carries the burden of his world on his shoulder my criticism however comes from the way both parties handle the trauma that their responsibility brings with themrba hate what theyve done to the world all of them have ptsd reigner has a split personality and annie cries any moment she can find for herselfthey dont allow their personal pain to harm their mission thougheren however does eren does that knowinglyive talked about the bit in trees before and its still the best example there is he reminds himself that for the sake of what he thinks is all of humanity he needs to ignore his emotions there he however decides that his own emotions are more importantyes hes just human and yes his life is tragic but that can not be an excuse to do whatever he wants in the situation hes in all the world that he knows off counts on him and he throws their hopes in the wind like theyre his old clothes he chooses to let his emotions overrule his reasoning and logic he lets his feelings dictate his actionsreigner bertolt and annie on the other hand have completely let loose of their own needs feelings and dreams they dont let their heart judge their actions but their heads they do whats logical whats best for the world and the people who count on them instead of whats best for themselvestheyre honorable reliable people whove been trusted with the faith of their world they decided to carry that burden to the enderen on the other hand just does what best for himself and his feelings when hes put in the same positionhe listens to feelings instead of reasonand thats why i hate him so much,46.0,27.0,31.0,10.0,84.0

yep thats your best bet if you arent inclined to sharpen your own i love sharpening mine but its a hobby thing and not for everyonething is once your knife gets dull you cant hone it back it needs to be done consistently everytime before or after you use it it just realigns the edge itll stay sharp a very long time if you do thisonce the knife gets a little dull itll be wavy like but still sharp throughout but once it gets really dull that point turns cone shaped and honing wont fix iti personally use a smooth steel like this but they can be ceramic too the most important thing when sharpening or honing is keeping the angle consistent throughout,9.0,61.0,13.0,4.0,72.0

overwatch is overflowing with clean players that is why i do it not often tbh i dont know on which server you play but i definitely get next to no cheatersvac bans are delayed and dont tell me it is easy to get cheats to be recognised by the systemalso the 40 you have banned on your vacstat list are probably followed up by 40 clean people and 20 more cheaters just give it time i dont know why you are so obsessed with seeing if they get a vac anyways first off all it leads to vac is shit threads where people without knowledge rage around and for the second part feeds your egocan i go into games now and say i have a 90 banned ratio on vacstat so you definitely cheatbut back to topic giving random people on the internet the ability to kick people from games is really dumb seriously think about it it would be better if people learn to report the right people for overwatch vac needs time anyways,2.0,92.0,31.0,60.0,53.0
unfortunately it is human nature for groups of people to fight in those kind of situations there have been psychological studies done with groups of 1112 year old childrentwo scenarios occur either people are low on some kind of resource and people will split up and fight between groups or you force people to cooperate for some mutual gain and everyone becomes friends the same thing happens without people knowing everyone elses type but it would probably be more rigid and obvious,34.0,21.0,82.0,74.0,20.0

yep basically this for all the things i love about cogfuncmention dominants they really tend to overhype things for themselves theyll get so excited about a new idea or something fun to do and then five minutes in theyre bored and ready for the next thing this is because in fact its coming up with the fun ideas that they enjoy not so much the experiences themselves for high cogfuncmention the actual doing of the thing is the culmination yeah it sounds excitingso lets go already well do all the things and well enjoy it to the fullest for as long as it lasts lets get startedaang strikes me as being more the second type of person yes he enjoys coming up with the fun ideas of stuff to do but he dives right in and doesnt quit until either necessity or sokka finally drags him away from it,70.0,33.0,46.0,6.0,33.0

theres a thing jokingly referred to as the ikea effect where you attribute a higher value to something the more time and effort you spend on itif dating resembles a massproduced drivethru experience then youll become less invested in the individual people youre seeing than if you take your time get to know someone very well and actively cultivate the relationship the shopping mentality of online dating is a very real emergent property and bears mentioning to lend greater context to your effortsthat is to say im sure there would have been dramatically different numbers reported if a quality over quantity method was heavily leaned upon good science normally requires a large sample size so the 42 dates over that timespan seems like a good method of data collection for someone interested in more casual relationshipsid be interested to see the stats on someones dating career if theyre extremely selective on who they go out with time spent on the different phases would be more demonstrative than an event count in that case id think,15.0,95.0,85.0,15.0,5.0

if a group of people were to affirm their ideology is based on the communist manifesto and das capital and call themselves the marxist party of ltinsert country namegt would we spend much time debating if they are true marxist or not no matter how distorted they would presents marxs ideas the only people that would go out of their way to say they arent marxists are other people that want to claim the label for themselves but are in disageement over what marxism truly is for those that dont subscribe to marxism there is not a incentive as big to figure out who is the true scotsman there we might look at stalinism and chinese communists and do an academic analysis of how far or close they are from marxs ideas we might even end up saying that its not communism anymore while still acknowledging the link what wouldnt make sense is go out of our way to take the communist brand out of their hand the obsession by nonfollowers of the islam faith to figure out what is or isnt true islam is really bizarre figuring out what is true islam is an impossible task for an nonmuslim ultimately muslisms themselves are trying to do that often with terrible consequence as they divide themselve in factions each believing to be right instead of arguing about what is or isnt islam we should argue about the consequences of holding certains ideas the consequences of words and belief and how people are influenced by them while for a muslim islam might have a very precise meaning the one that he subscribe to for a nonmuslism its only a umbrella label and useful and necessary one but nothing more than a label,39.0,89.0,1.0,22.0,61.0

heres what works for me theres more to it if youre serious about it and i admit i have some personal twists that may not be ideal but i think this is still a decent procedure to get startedfind a reasonably comfortable spot and have a seat take a minute or two to get acquainted with your surroundings and to simply relax yes that part is important especially when youre getting started with meditation then close your eyes and gradually slow your breathing a bit thats all preparatorynow stop thinking just breathe and let your thoughts fade dont try to evaluate how well youre doing or how the meditation is going and dont worry about getting perfect posture or deep breaths or anything like that just let everything go if any thoughts or feelings do come into your mind dont let them linger but dont let them have significance either ie dont get after yourself for accidentally thinking about things calmly and simply acknowledge their existence and let them fade if you find your mind needs a place to go you can try focusing on a simple mental image or alternatively on observing not judging or altering your breathing keep doing this for a whilewhen you feel ready to finish open your eyes but change nothing else stay still keep avoiding thinking etc then gradually shift back to normal however it feels most natural to yougood luck,70.0,33.0,46.0,6.0,33.0

i think people tend to forget that typemention lead with a perception function and we tend to be big observers of people and what they say and do when someone is very direct and forceful in what they say some typemention might get an impression that the more forceful person could be closeminded about certain topics or disapproving and the typemention might feel like they have to be careful in case they upset the other person with a dissenting opinionanother thing is the typemention just needs time to get to know you better were pattern finders until theyve figured you out enough where they know whats safe and what are things you dont like etc they might be throwing up a bunch of smokescreens while they put things together just being really consistent is key theyll pick up your patterns and get a better idea of who you are and how you express yourself also as long as youre being blunt and open you might as well do the same with your feelings its ok to just say stuff like im not trying to make you nervous or put you on the spot i just like being open and direct were also fine with stuff like im going to ask for your patience im not used to such abstract conversations i prefer really direct communication so if i come across as blunt or like im not engaged in what youre saying its just that im figuring stuff out i mean you can make it sound much better than that but dont be worried about just stating what youre going through typemention like clarity so they will probably appreciate it we spend a lot of time in our heads so i personally find it nice when someone either confirms or denies my ideas i have about them with direct data and feedback i also appreciate it when someone explains their behavior the more i know about their motives and inner mentalemotional condition the better ill be about responding to and accommodating you specifically and trusting you more just keep trying and being sincere we can sometimes require a lot of patience,83.0,80.0,46.0,37.0,14.0

yep especially for engineerings i think 90 or so gets their masters those 10 who dont do so because a university degree simply turned out to be too difficult for them or because of personal reasons really the only exception to this rule is compsci for which the demand is so astronomically big that companies have good offers ready for bachelor students and will further train them in house if youre thinking of doing chemeng in the netherlands i highly recommend getting your masters degree over here as well its two years tuition fees are about 14k a year for students outside of the us there are several options the technical universities but also the university of groningen the only nontechnical research university that offers engineering doing your masters over here will get you a diploma which employers will recognize youll get two years to learn the language a bit though this is not a requirement like it would be in germany or france and youll build a network so youll get a job quickly starting salaries are about 28003000 euros a month before taxes which puts you on average not even median which is far lower salary already at the start of your career for dutch wages just to put demand into perspective for chemengs,46.0,27.0,31.0,10.0,84.0

not an typemention but a fellow nt if that matters i really like what has been suggested in this thread and similar to what ubigbohemia expressed you expressed your feelings here i think that if your identity and worldview is primarily your thoughts then its natural to primarily communicate those people only have so many tools to express emotion and they primarily work with only a handful thereof what i try to do is to tell people when i notice something i appreciate about them often this happens when im considering who they are how they operate etc or it happens on the fly either way i make a mental note to tell them about it in an offhand joking way if i dont know them well or in a more sincere sometimes also offhand joking manner if they already know im not a creep you can do this in small talk as well i told a dude i barely know the other day your tie is super rad orange with sea turtles good choice is this entirely appropriate no but whatever i thought his tie was cool and i said so i didnt stop to think about how i was going to say it how it would make me look what he might think of it i just said it he seemed pleased everyone wins if i thought his tie was shit i wouldnt say anything unless he was a friend of mine and seemed generally secure you are obviously self conscious they call it self conscious for a reason think about what those words actually mean i think its good to introspect etc but when you are with people focus on what theyre doing give them the benefit of the doubt but consider what theyre thinkingfeelingsaying and not about you most people will give you the benefit of the doubt and they have their own insecurities etc if theyre talking to you its probably because they want to be they want you to listen and most importantly they want you to approve of them all humans want and need approval tell them what you approve of tell them when you agree with them when you disagree with them try to find some part of what they said that you do agree with be agreeable while you disagree and you are still being honest and genuine and creating a lively warm discussion you dont have to beam smiles at everyone or be super huggy or whatever just extrovert your positive thoughts about people and about the world if you arent having many of those i think its a good idea to seek some help theres no shame in seeing a doctor when youre sick and when your head is a little under the weather we have specialists for that my friend that you are working on self improvement and on being able to relate better to others not just focused on manipulating people or the like means that youre likely a good dude i hope this helps,15.0,85.0,15.0,85.0,15.0

typemention are often scary to talk to both my so and best friend understand how to communicate with me though bottom line is thisat any point in life work project whatever i know exactly where im going and how ill get there this does not mean this route is set in stone but it does mean this is the best path i could come up with having considered everything so both my so and friend often tell other people who are a bit intimidated by me when you discuss things with avacyn it feels like kicking a dead horse and she simply doesnt want to listen because she thinks she knows best but in reality she is actually listening very closely and is simply challenging you on your own opinion in any way she can come up with give it a week or two and if your argument was strong enough shell get back to you with new updated plans based on your inputthis was a huge eye opener for many people in my social circle but also for myself as i honestly did not know how my behaviour came across to other people who arent used to thing style of discussing things,46.0,27.0,31.0,10.0,84.0
hello there im in a bit of a hurry but i will try to answer some of your questionshobart is very much the centre of tasmanian cultural and social life with about 40 of the states population more if you include the greater urban area launceston is the next biggest city at about 100 000 people and considers itself hobarts rival for complicated historical reasons there is a small but decent arts scene not much nightlife sometimes not much work unless you know people housing is cheaper than in the large cities of the mainland but rent and utilities can be expensive inner hobart is beautiful with many historic buildings and a very humanfriendly scale due to being quite densely populated in the premotorcar era the outer suburbs vary from being godbenighted welfare slums to comfortable but bland modern suburbs we have nominally decent public healthcare in australia but in tasmania there can be very long waiting lists for elective nonemergency surgery we do have old age pensions and superannuation but it can be a pretty bleak existence if you dont own a home and rely on the pension publicly funded nursing homes are overstretchedyou may be happy to learn that there is a sizeable polish community in tasmania due to postwar migration there is a club a footballsoccer team and a very good polish butcher delicatessenour seasons are more european than any other place in australia although temperate rather than continental we have snow on our mountains in winter crisp autumns fresh springs and mild to warm summers personally i find the climate delightful as do many people from europetasmanians still retain a closer connection to the country than in most parts of australia we are one of the least urbanised states and most people are only a generation or two removed from rural life our countryside is beautiful a very special mixture of australian bush and european cultivation not to mention our uniquely tasmanian wildernessthats all i can think of for now feel free to ask more questions,2.0,98.0,88.0,0.0,20.0

few monthes ago i did a large test of damage items on ta for my own i created an enemy pudge and fed him so he has alot of healthso i compared all damage items and with clock fixed how many seconds it would take to make pudge go to 2k hp pudge had several ten thousands of hp cant remeber exactlywithout meld deso 26 seconds deadal 25s mkb 25s two daedaluses 15s desodaedal 12s radiance 26swith meld by cddeso 20 secs daedal 18s mkb 21s radiance 22sdaedalus and mkbs are both rngish items so it can varies ofc what i conclude for myself is that deso is really cost efficiant item and can compete with other expensive damage items despite costing much less even if it loses to them abit but by not alot also that mkb and daedalus is very similar items dps wise daedalus is abit better not by muchi induce everyone to go and do such test by themself and see on practice without graphs and theory how fast this 40k hp pudge dies with different item setups its very insightful i did tons of combinations pairs of items aswell not gonna list them all there,40.0,98.0,1.0,1.0,83.0
i dont disagree with what youve said to expand on the simplified what why how i think why is a combination of what and how between many variables whereas what and how are primitive concrete data points lemme take a stab at why what and how by function cogfuncmention why is this thing x way based on the whats and hows what pattern does it conform to what are the links between that pattern and other patterns ie how do they interact cogfuncmention reduces whats and hows to essences then adds those to construct a why cogfuncmention what am i looking at and how is it connected could it be connected in this way if the whats were different could it then connect in this way cogfuncmention is much like cogfuncmention but it quickly takes all the whats and hows and slams them together into many possible arrangements its like a brute force decryption cogfuncmention why would that thing connect or not do the whats and hows add up or actually fit together cogfuncmention what am i looking at what is actually happening and how what are all the steps from a to z cogfuncmention why do i feel the way i do what meaning is to be found when i combine all the whats and hows of my feels cogfuncmention what and how do other people feel cogfuncmention supplies the why cogfuncmention supplies more whats and hows for cogfuncmention to chew on cogfuncmention supplies the whys as externalities in the form of traditions and past practices because this is how it was done in the past and that worked ok,15.0,85.0,15.0,85.0,15.0

i think a little bit of both on one hand there are a lot of cogfuncmention behaviors that are subconscious like mirroring the other persons demeanor speech patterns body language etc sometimes that is an active choice and other times its a natural reaction to meeting a new person and trying to create a comfortable mutual experiencethis mirroring is done to reduce conflict and create a conducive environment for getting to know someone if there are obvious similarities then the typemention will probably be more forthcoming if the typemention isnt sure where someone stands on a particular issue theyll probably wait to find out before deciding if its safe to share and that their ideas or beliefs will be given a fair chance,83.0,80.0,46.0,37.0,14.0

biotech is gonna be huge in the coming decades for two reasons1 these technologies havent yet hit the exponential part of their logistic curve think of what happened to computers in the last 20 years and that should give you an idea of whats coming2 due to the retiring baby boomers health care will be a major concern for the next 30 years which should provide a huge source of fundingits advancing fastweve successfully bioprinted some organs and bones and successfully implanted them into patients were also bioprinting skin and cloning bloodi think its plausible well be able to do it before 2050 though im not sure people will ever be very comfortable with amputationsit may be easier to regenerate limbs in place than bioprint them and theres some progress on that in mice though growing a human limb would take years due to the size it may be possible to speed it up someid guess by 2030 it will be widespread but will start being used in some cases by 2020all that but also refining of the technologies involved conventional 3d printers have problems such as heat denaturation so some companies are now working on equipment specially optimized for bioprintingskeptically its a promising field but individual startups in the pharma and biotech industry have a high failure ratetheyll wait until startups turn a profit and then buy them when one of these startups has a favorable price to earnings ratio a big company will snap them uporganovo is a front runner they might show enough profit this year to get bought out probably by pfizer or roche which have worked with them before so they already know the people and the productnope the first company to make money printing something simple are the ones who will get billions thrown at them,12.0,84.0,7.0,53.0,54.0

ive wondered whether the rooster or the hen came first what is so different about us is that we walk upright and have huge heads this presents a couple of mechanical difficulties womens pelvises had to move forward and become tighter while ideally they would have substantially wider hips to accommodate huge baby heads they may have needed more muscle to push that baby head through that too small pelvic gap its worth considering that we are one of few creatures which has sex for pleasure so we may have needed bigger dicks to stimulate more of that now larger opening additionally because we walk upright and wimmens have big round butts theres some distance to cover there to the window to the wall,15.0,85.0,15.0,85.0,15.0

technology is improving quickly enough for the developers to easily have room for more pokã mon in new games but they may be forced into putting less work into improving pokã mon from previous generations due to time constraints we will probably start to see models reused from the previous generations many unchanging movepools etc however i believe that they can get way beyond 1000 before this becomes neccesssaryas for catching pokã mon the goal should probably be more focused on catching the entire regional dex at some point as there will simply be far too many pokã mon for catching em all to seem plausible to most people of course one could still attempt this and it would be an even greater challenge which i see as a good thingi people can complete the shiny living dex than they can easily register 10000 pokã mon in their pokã dex which we wont get until centuries from nowdespite this i still believe that we will be seeing more focus on gameplay than new pokã mon as we did in x and y as gamefreak must realise that releasing new pokã mon at the rate of the first 5 generations will be hard to keep up in a few decades,78.0,62.0,61.0,15.0,38.0

i could not define them adequately i read every single definition including socionics i could find and tried to use them to type people and never found them to be consistent theres usually no way to ever rule out similar alternative types for any given person so i went to the source jungs book psychological types is supposed to explain exactly what the functions are and i went through it very thoroughly thinking carefully about the implications of every single sentence and idea its written to dazzle and obscure its lack of substance for example jung will tell you that an extrovert perceives in the order of object subject object and introvert perceives subject object subject its really just an obtuse way to describe the relation between perception and thought and i see no clear evidence of this pattern in people that would indicate their preference there is also no reason to use this description of ie over the more scientific understanding that relates to relative sensitivity to stimulation and describes all of the classical behaviour that you undoubtedly already understand this description actually characterises people meaningfully and has implications in the real world jungs idea that i do not find convincing is at the heart of every function its the supposed difference between cogfuncmention and cogfuncmention so after that the whole theory breaks down and i guess theres not much need to point out how he uses the same tricks astrologers use in their profiles to describe their functions i spent years jumping types every month using cognitive function theory after looking into jung i decided to just go back to basics and try to find solid ground to stand on i find the definitions given by myers briggs foundation are adequate using their descriptions i feel much more sure of where i stand despite my flair my actual type is typemention by their description and i used to be more of an typemention when i first started with mbti during school years shhh dont tell anyone i swap my flair for fun still even mbti i think is pretty flawed youd expect that given it was created based on jungs work by the briggs who werent even psychologists the big five generally patches up those holes and proves itself more useful particularly with the statistical findings that are around,34.0,21.0,82.0,74.0,20.0

while i agree with you that the not a true christian argument isnt being used by christian much i wonder if the possibility of confession played a role in case like priest molesting children just an hypothesis if priests could molest children and go confess themselves or ask forgiveness to god for what they did recites the paternoster 3 times and be clean it might have played a role and this doctrine of forgiveness which is not necessarly a bad idea could have been used by those in the higher rank of the catholic church to give a free pass to the bad apples,39.0,89.0,1.0,22.0,61.0

the reason for singers popularity is twofold animal rights supporters publicised his book which provide intuitivebutambiguouslyrational arguments for veganism id argue that singerian views on animal rights are irrational unless framed robustly most people who hold singerian views are intuitionist which id argue makes their views irrational by definition part of my point in the first post this is why singer was popular in the 80s singers books on effective altruism and ted talks are what made him popular in recent timescommon arguments would be things like i like meat i am speciesist i do not empathise with factory farmed animals i intentionally avoid circumstances where i might empathise with factory farmed animals though i may agree with vegans on animal rights pain promotion etc i still have compelling reasons to eat meat where my individual consumption does not impact on animal rightspain promotion individual consumption of mass produced meat does not increase production ie has marginal impact on these thingsim sure there are more those are off the top of my head,2.0,85.0,2.0,86.0,30.0
